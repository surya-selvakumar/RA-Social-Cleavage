          "body": ">A paper prepared by Scottish Government civil servants for First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned that taxpayers could face an income tax rate of 50 per cent across all bands to fund the scheme.\n\n>Despite the tax rises, there would still be a funding shortfall of £3.6bn.\n\nThis sounds crazy, if you raise taxes up to 50% on all bands, people will surely just move the short distance from Edinburgh and Glasgow into England?

But my thought process was more with the whole of the DWP and the country. But i honestly don't know enough right now and i can't really back up most of what im saying, so essentially this is \"just a thought\" rather then anything concrete. But its very difficult to respond to a bunch of thoughts rather then if i said anything tangible.\n\nBut my thoughts were along the lines of with a universal income you don't need as much admin because there is less of a choice to be made. With the DWP apparently costing ~~700 billion~~ (including the welfare budget) a year how much could that be rolled into efficiency savings and essentially pushed into the universal income budget.\n\nAdditionally with the government providing a universal income that could then potentially be passed onto businesses with a reduction in the minimum wage which would allow people to compete with both automation, and low payed migrant workers. \n\nAlso could there be a sliding gradient where as you earn more from employment you gradually recieve less from the universal income (but not at a rate where a pay rise is seen as a bad thing). \n\nAgain these are just thoughts nothing concrete.\n\nEdit: I miss read an article 700b figure was very wrong thats total government spend.",

Money can, ultimately, be magicked out of thin air by the government should they choose to change the law such that they can do so.  I mean, ultimately, money is just a national-level version of a gift voucher, which can be exchanged for real goods and services.  It's those goods and services which are (and always would be) the limiting factor.  Besides which it's just a transfer payment, which can always be afforded because it's just moving money from one pocket to another.\n\nThe arguments against it come more from human cognitive failings when it comes to things like temporal preference inversions meaning that sometimes it might be better to give people things like housing vouchers or whatever than cash (food stamps in the USA are a good example too).\n\nThe 15 hour work week mentioned in the article is also nonsense, unless you can somehow figure out how to stop people constantly trying to competitively one-up each other, which is basically the driving force behind things like overwork.",

We need higher wages and lower living costs but those will only come when we improve productivity. This could be done by providing more funding to new technologies - I.E. 3D printing - that show a lot of promise.\n\nWe also need to teach students more about computers, how they work etc. The new BBC microbit is a step in the right direction but really should also be given to students of all ages, rather than just lower years.\n\n>if the UBI is the next 'big step' to compensate for those technological advances.\n\nI think that the whole worry over new technology is unfounded. There will always be a need for more \"human\" roles like judges, lawyers, writers, artists etc. and there will also be a need for people to fix these new technologies and to create them.\n\n>but it's clearly a lot more nuanced that 'give all the money to people'.\n\nSure, there are merits to the idea. It might make sense to provide a version of UBI to only those earning below a certain amount so that they will spend more and will have a higher quality of life.",

          "body": "Reposted from /r/economics.\n\n**The concept of paying people to sit around has an upside, writes Tim Harford.**\n\n‘Swiss to vote on 2,500 franc basic income for every adult.” Reuters, 4 October 2013\n\n**How much is that?**\n\nIt’s about £1,700 a month – over £20,000 a year.\n\n**Payable to whom?**\n\nEverybody, or at least, every adult citizen. It’s called a “basic income” and everyone gets it, no strings attached.\n\n**You have to be joking**\n\nWe’ll have to see whether the Swiss think it’s funny or not – they are holding a referendum, which is something they do quite a lot. But the idea of a basic income suddenly seems to be back on the radar after many years of being out of fashion. The New York Times announced recently that at the cocktail parties of Berlin there is talk of little else; US policy wonks are getting excited about it too.\n\n**This sounds like some communist plot. How can anyone take seriously the idea of paying people to sit around on their backsides?**\n\nThe idea is endorsed not only by experts on inequality such as Oxford’s Sir Tony Atkinson, but by the late Milton Friedman, an unlikely communist. The idea of a basic income is one that unites many left- and rightwingers while commanding very little support in the mainstream.\n",

                      "body": "Disproportionately though.  If you're earning £20k at the moment, and they introduce a £15k universal income then it's not £20k + £15kbasic for a total of £35k, but £15k + (£20k-£15k) for a total of £20k.  \n\nThat is you'd still be doing the same hours but now only for an additional £5000 a year.  When you consider that people will also have to incur extra costs travelling to and from work it's not difficult to see how people are not going to work 45 hours a week for what might add up to only an extra £10 day.   Companies are going to have to start paying a lot more to fill these typical ~£20k jobs, and that means either they start laying people off and adding to the workload of those that remain or hiking prices.\n\nThat's the proposal, or the 'working' solution that Switizerland is looking at.\n\nMy major concern isn't even that.  It's much simpler than that.  If for example we say we pay 45 million people £15,000 universal income, then that's £675bn a year - or roughly the entire current government spend as a percentage of GDP (slightly more if we look at ratio projection for the following year).  That means before you spend a single penny on schools, health, roads, R&D, police, defence, fireservice, parks, refuse, infrastructure or anything else everything has gone...\n\nSo before anybody gets carried away thinking that on the face of this it sounds like a swing to the left understand that the universal income will quickly become the price for all the other services we already have and will provide the perfect vehicle to introduce privatisation-max.  Insurance premiums and policies, toll roads,...\n\n",

They even say it's a 'thank you' for helping and not 'pay', but I am scared to risk it.  I'd also be able to do more volunteer work, without the DWP hunting me down for daring to spend 16 hours a week 'not actively seeking work', and instead doing something useful to society.\n\nYou'd find those who really didn't want to work wouldn't, and as such, wouldn't be a detriment to workplaces they were forced into.  Those who didn't want to work much could take part time work, and it'd mean there was enough work to go around, and those who crave luxuries, money or power can go for it, and carry on doing 60 hour weeks if they like.",

If people aren't forced to do crap jobs then we would probably find that employers would have to either massively increase pay or invest a lot more money in automation; this investment would be of huge benefit to humanity.\n\nFurthermore, like you say, people could simply share skills to get smaller tasks done. Imagine if the council just posted a \"jobs\" website where they literally had a bunch of stuff that got reported that it needed doing. You'd go on, find a job you could do (e.g. cleaning up an old ladies floor because she had a problem in the kitchen, filling in some gaps in some paving stones, putting up a shelf in the community centre) take a picture to provide proof, someone else gets a job to verify it and then you earn a few quid. If you try and game the system you'd get spotted pretty quick and all that would happen would be that the verifiers would be more stringently selected before your work got signed off.\n\nWe should stop vilifying the unemployed, assuming they aren't working, imposing sanctions on them, punishing them for actually working once a week, cash in hand, from a bloke that can't afford to give them regular work and find solutions to these problems to help people contribute and lead meaningful lives. Minimum income really could work.",

We'd have the situation where we could drop all earned income by the minimum wage and then just do basic income + some amount. This means we would could have state employees, like teachers, that are a) happy to strike if they force you to do anything you think is immoral b) can employ more employees selecting from a wider pool of candidates. Jobs that people don't want to do (e.g. being a bin man) would have incentive increased until you reach a stable employment level.\n\nIn this model we could support those that need more support; the elderly, the disabled, the sick, with significantly more power than the current system because we could provide incentive for more moralistic jobs in the same manner. Our biggest state payout, by far, is pensions; with minimum income you remove this and you no longer need any kind of fixed retirement age.\n\nLayabouts that just want to sit around and play games all day (something I can hugely get behind) would actually be massively disincentive for not working because private entities would have to increase labour costs to compete with jobs like cleaning up shit all day. As a result, I predict that costs of expensive to fund leisure activities would increase until you get to a stable distribution of workers.\n\nAt the moment we have a society where the wealthiest do the least work; I know a few people, for example, that make a shit ton just staying at home selling trading cards and bit coins. They work very little and make a huge amount of money; if people's fear is that it will incentive the lazy then... sorry to tell you this, but this is the society we live in; no one really gets properly rich through hard work. They get their trough social networking, luck and paying the right people to do work for them. \n\nWork would be voluntary and value would be derived from labour not purely based on speculative value. Minimum income is the best path to a truly free society that doesn't involve a violent a bloody process. ",

                      "body": "From the article:\n\n> **What about special cases – people with severe and expensive disabilities?**\n> \n> Friedman argued in Free to Choose, a book published in 1980, that such cases would be few enough that private charities would deal with them. I am not sure the modern world would accept that answer. And this does point to a general concern about basic income schemes: they look efficient and neat on paper but in reality one suspects that the complexities of the modern welfare state would fail to disappear. We would probably have exemptions for immigrants, housing allowances for Londoners, and all the rest.",

The logic being that the land and the resources it holds should really belong to everyone and everyone should profit from them.\n\nAlso, with the introduction of basic income you could reduce the current welfare bill by around 75%, all I'd say you need to leave is benefits for disability, child benefit and housing benefits in areas where housing costs are high. You could also reverse the Lib Dem changes to the tax threshold, since a basic income would help low earners more than this anyway.\n\nEdit: [WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income#Affordability_studies) also has a section on how it could be affordable (not UK specific but still interesting)\n\nEdit 2: We currently spend around £202 billion annually on welfare, including pensions. That's almost £5,000 per adult. We afford to pay a low basic income to every adult out of our current welfare spending if we choose to.",

If the minimum wage didn't increase then people would be in dire straits. \n\nMinimum wage at the moment gets you a salary of £23809 if you work 37.5 hours per week. \n\nAssuming a 3% pension contribution that works out at £1674/month after tax. \n\nRent: £700\nUtilities: £150\nCouncil tax: £100\nFood: £200\nBroadband: £20\nMobile: £10\nTransport: £100\n\nLeftover: ~£400\n\nThat needs to cover any unexpected expenses, entertainment, savings, and I've been conservative in my estimates.",

It’s about making the economy function more effectively so the whole country can share in prosperity rather than accept the stagnant status quo. Something’s not working so we need a different approach.\n\nI wouldn’t systematically make things worse for min wage workers. I proposed ultimately tieing min wage to an inflation index.

          "body": "The minimum wage (and most other employment laws that benefit workers at the expense of employers) effectively prices the least productive people out of employment. If an employer can’t turn a profit on someone whose productivity falls below a legally mandated threshold, they simply won’t hire them, or else they’ll find ways to sidestep the law. While some argue that ‘studies show minimal impacts on overall employment,’ those figures tend to gloss over what happens at the margins, where the youngest, least skilled, or otherwise disadvantaged workers get shut out of the job market altogether. The fact that a broad statistical average doesn’t crater doesn’t help the individual who can’t break into that first rung on the career ladder because his productivity can’t justify the artificially inflated wage.\n\nThose people, already struggling to offer what employers now demand, find themselves with nowhere to go but onto public assistance or into under-the-table work. Minimum wage laws and employment regulations, in this sense, end up shackling both employees and employers, preventing them from freely agreeing on terms that reflect actual abilities and constraints. By disrupting that fundamental freedom to negotiate, we create a class of individuals who become institutionalized into living off benefits or drawn to illegal enterprises. Unregulated trades like drug dealing or prostitution don’t ask for a résumé or insist on a government-approved pay floor, so it’s hardly surprising that many turn there when formal avenues are mandated inaccessable by law.\n\nYou can’t conjure higher productivity by passing a wage law. But you can raise the barrier to entry so high that those with limited skills are all but banned from the labor force, then act surprised when many resort to undesirable alternatives or end up trapped on welfare.\n\nI think a system that allows even severely disadvantaged people in the UK to secure employment would be better. Because having a job, even a low paying one, contributes to ones people’s mental health, self-esteem, and future prospects. That first low-paying job often serves as a stepping stone to higher paid work later on, since it helps build the experience and skills that raise a person’s productivity level and attractiveness to employers.",

They control the capital, are responsible for re-investing in the business, and determine policies and practices. \n\nWorkers on the other hand have a marginal impact. Yes some work harder than other but all need to meet a minimum standard of productivity or the risk being fired. Even if they work incredibly hard, their productivity is bounded by the structure of the company/institution as a whole. \n\nAlso worth noting is that minimum wage has nothing to do with productivity. It’s there to ensure that employers are paying just shy of what the average adult need to sustain themselves. The reason it keeps increasing is that the cost of living keeps rising.",

But, it is too high as a proportion of average wage. We need growth in wages above minimum, and we need graduate jobs to pay more than minimum wage. I used to be an architect, it took 7 years to train and about 100k in student loans. After several years grinding 8am-8pm most days for minimum wage without overtime pay I left when I found out my friend working in McDonald's was earning more. ( Because they got paid for the hours they actually worked). \n\nWe need to end the 'your paid 9-5 but your expected to work longer' practice. It was fine when people were earning good salaries, but now it's just a way to pay less than minimum wage. \n\nWe should have a minimum salary that is higher than minimum wage if you're only accepting people with a degree. This would mean a lot of jobs that ask for one, would remove this requirement and prevent everyone having to get trapped in debt for no reason. \n\nAnd we should find ways to increase salary ranges. The vast majority of salaries are concentrated in the under 50k range. We want a good stratified earnings across sectors. That would bring in more tax and we could remove things like the 100k tax trap as we would be less reliant on a small number providing the majority of all tax revenue.",

              "body": "What you have described is true of minimum and lower wage jobs but not of higher earning jobs.\n\nThis is one of the biggest differences between high and low paid jobs. Low paid jobs are often people delivering some form of service function that is repeatable / trainable on the job. All employees are expected to deliver to the same standard and it is difficult to exceed that.\n\nHigher paid jobs are normally cases where there is not a set role or service function and it is the employee that has to add value using their own skills and expertise independent to the job. Those jobs are much higher risk (because there can be massive variations in value add and therefore risks of lay offs for poor performance). These are cases where the productivity of the employees will directly influence our tax take and overall productivity as a nation, and at present these employees are taxed upwards of 50% in some bands which completely kills any productivity incentive. We need to sort this out if we want to achieve our growth targets.",

                  "body": "Yes the meaning of 'Productivity' can be misleading people often treat it like it's farmers growing more corn or something.\n\nMostly it refers to Labour productivity growth which is simply a measurement of output (generally in GDP) per hour worked. \n\nAnything that affects the ratio between those will affect it. Usually it used to determine how many jobs/hours can we cut without affecting output. \n\nBut it is also affected by macro effects to the economy like in a recession GDP could be expected to go down more than hours worked so it would go down. After a recession 'leaner' companies are expected be able to produce more with fewer hours so it might then increase. \n\nLook on the graph at the diiference between the effect on Covid on GDP and Productivity and compare with the 08' financial crisis. The hours worked decreased in both, obviously more during covid, but not as much as one might suspect because of all the long hours by essential workers. But the effect on productivity is notably lesser during covid, probably because of the aggressive actions government took to keep the economy ticking. Although I'm not sure how furlough is considered in there.\n\nThe author of this article make some spurious conclusions about the connection to the minimum wage in my opinion.",

And it all screams a bunch of people overvaluing their worth, and massively undervaluing the worth of people that have been paid far too little on minimum wage jobs for far too long.\n\n\n---------------\n\n\nTLDR: If your job got caught up with minimum wage, but you're not willing to move jobs to an \"easier\" job, we both know why, it's because your role was never worth more than all the people doing other roles... the role isn't actually easier, or better, is it... You'd happily go stack shelves in tesco if you believed that.",

The job shortages in the NHS at the minute are all a huge facade because they don't have the budget to hire them so therefore are purposefully not filling gaps irrelevant of overseas or not. \n\nThat doesn't take away the fact that the government have been replacing uk nurses with overseas nurses to try fill the gaps? It doesn't matter if it's effective or not hiring thousands of people form overseas is making skilled health workers replaceable, no? I'm not saying for the better but the band aids been put on and all appears well on paper.

          "body": ">Good morning. Below are some thoughts on a bold economic experiment George Osborne embarked on that Labour has continued. No, it’s not austerity, but the big increases in the statutory wage floor.\n\n\n>**The cost of ‘making work pay’**\n\n\n>In 2015, Osborne did two things: he drastically cut back in-work benefits and significantly increased the minimum wage, setting the target that it would reach 60 per cent of median earnings by 2020. Since returning to office, Labour has continued that approach, with another chunky increase having come into force yesterday. This has drastically reduced low pay in the UK. Here’s the key chart from the Resolution Foundation\n\n\n>When Osborne changed how the minimum wage worked, one worker in 10 had an hourly rate less than two-thirds of the median. Now just one in 29 do.\n\n\n>I have to hold my hands up here. I did not think this was a good idea. I thought it was a good policy proposal that would exert too high a price. I thought shifting the balance of responsibility for supporting the incomes of working-age people between employers and the state would be bad for the economy, hurting smaller businesses and people at the bottom of the income distribution. I thought it would lead to more automation and therefore more unemployment, but that productivity would increase.\n\n\n>That didn’t happen. But it’s worth stopping and thinking about Keith Fray’s terrific chart — the most important chart, I think, in British politics.\n\n\n>Obviously I’m not saying that a change Osborne made to how the UK sets its minimum wage in 2015 is why the UK has had such bad GDP and productivity growth since the financial crisis. What I am saying is this: it is striking that it doesn’t appear to have done anything at all for UK productivity.\n\n\n>We simply don’t know enough about why the UK has a higher number of people on sickness benefits than peer countries. But I continue to suspect one reason is that a consequence of the higher minimum wage is that work even at the mezzanine level of the economy has become much more intense. \n(We will get a big, useful bit of empirical research on this at the end of the year, though the Resolution Foundation’s analysis also suggests this.)\n\n\n>Labour is doubling down on Osborne’s shift in responsibility, with not only an increase in the minimum wage but a rise in employers’ national insurance contributions.\n\n\n>Increasing the minimum wage is a great lever to improve earnings at the bottom of the labour market. But, like all policies, it has costs as well as benefits.\n\n\n>I continue to think part of why we have more young people not in employment, education or training (Neet) and why work has become more intense is that employers have responded to these increased costs by asking for more in return. That may be a price worth paying for a lower in-work benefits bill for the state. But it also has implications for working conditions and welfare expenditure.\n\n\n>What drives the UK’s higher rates of sickness and inactivity among the working age population? Broadly speaking, among the young it is increased anxiety — which makes them a poor fit for a workplace that is becoming more intense. Among older workers it is physical ailments, which are causing people to drop out of the labour market a little earlier than their age of eligibility for the state pension. Increased workplace intensity has implications for these workers too, because it creates a colder world for people who are beginning to slow down.\n\n\n>As I say, this is a good policy idea. But it comes with a price tag. Just as taxing everyone to increase tax credits is a good policy that comes with a price tag. And the costs of the new approach to “make work pay” may well pull against everything else Labour is trying to do.",

I’m very fortunate that I have a good salary, because I work my bollocks off, not because I’m lucky as some would believe, but where’s the incentive to work harder when people on minimum wage get a government enforced 16-18% pay rise and my employer argue the toss over 3-4%? \n\nI’m in no way saying people on minimum wage don’t work hard, or that their hourly rate is enough but skilled workers are seriously having the piss taken out of them.

Immigration has been kept high, which keeps minimum wage labor cost low, which has by some been seen as good for businesses, as there is a very direct incentive for businesses to pay workers less. But paying workers more does not necessarily detract from GDP per hour worked as when workers have more to spend, they buy more, and they become less reliant on governement welfare. So in the long run, everyone hurts from allowing poor wages (rising slower than the rate of inflation).",

It's not really exploiting them if they're paying someone the minimum wage - and that's all they can afford to pay them. The employee has to make the decision as to whether they want to work for said employer or find other employers.\n\nAlso the issue isn't soley re. the minimum wage.

For example, in industries that make intensive use of information technologies (IT), US multinationals obtained higher productivity from IT than non-US multinationals even when located in Britain or other parts of Europe. Moreover, this difference could be almost entirely explained by the different forms of managerial capability. This helps to explain why so many new technologies produce such disappointing results, as the tech spend needs to be complemented by organisational innovations driven by better management. We calculated that around half of the faster productivity growth between the US and Europe in the decade after the mid-1990s could be accounted for by managerial differences.\n\nThey also say that UK management is rubbish, under-trained, doesn't adapt, etc. There are also negative productivity differences in companies run by 2nd generation owners, and in [another article](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/25/bad-managers-on-brilliant-pay-thats-why-the-uks-not-working) another researcher from that team is supposed to have found that a lot of the UK's mid table management respectability comes from multi-nationals with UK subsidiaries (who presumably do have more training and investment). \n\nGenerally, the UK has been a low investment economy for decades outside london and a few other places, and you'd expect low productivity in that environment.",

              "body": "This is fairly straightforward to explain. You just need to follow where the money goes vs where it has gone in future. There are several parts to this. \n\nFirst the tech itself.\n\nIf you look around you can't fail to notice that technology and automation have encroached into every part of life. Your local shop has a single assistant managing half a dozen self-checkouts, your amazon delivery driver's logistics route is plotted out to the minute by a computer to ensure the maximally efficient route. And office work is increasingly automated and assisted by tech. Productivity should be going through the roof, but it is not. \n\nIn the past if you owned a factory and bought a new widget loom, you could make several widget weavers redundant. But you'd also need to employ a highly skilled widget loom operator. And more skilled workers would be required to build install and service the widget looms. You, your investors and the widget loom factory owners all get very wealthy. Your unemployed widget weavers would have to find something else to do, but fortunately there are some newly wealthy upper-middle-class and lower-middle-class people who are looking to spend their new wealth, maybe buy some grander houses, home appliances, fancier clothes, whatever. Or services like restaurants, insurance. So there are new skilled jobs doing that for your widget weavers to move into.\n\nContrast that with today's situation. The tech, rather than requiring skilled operators is designed to be used by the lowest paid workers.  So they don't get any more money to spend in the economy. The suppliers of the tech are now software companies who are probably based overseas, and in any case hoarding their wealth there. The servicing of the tech, again is a lot of software, serviced remotely and with relatively low paid experts. The result of that is that the increased efficiency doesn't unlock demand for new products and services, because the workers who are left don't have any additional money, and the workers you've lost or don't need to hire can't move into those areas of higher demand.  \n\nNow we come to the second point. In years gone by the investors, managers and owners of the means of production would have spent their increased income within the economy. But today a lot of that ownership is in the hands of hedge funds, pensions and so on, or else goes into the pockets of very few stupendously wealthy oligarchs. The common factor of all of those groups is that they have absolutely no need or desire to spend the vast majority of their wealth. Instead it's hoarded in tax havens or invested in property empires. \n\nThe issue is that much of the GDP and productivity growth comes from that money being re-spent within the economy, and that's not happening enough. And because so much of the wealth is being tied up in assets like housing, the cost of actually living in that housing is ratcheting up into a bigger and bigger slice of the average wage packet.\n\nThere is another factor which is that the price of stuff keeps getting cheaper and cheaper largely due to overseas manufacturing. I guarantee that the worst TV you can buy in Argos today is significantly better than the best one you could buy from them in 1990 in every significant way. Your entertainment and appliances are significantly cheaper than they would have been, so while one can sneer at someone with a 52inch screen in a tiny council flat, in terms of a proportion of income, it probably cost no more than a 20inch CRT would have cost a few short decades ago. But the cost of production all goes overseas. And your retailer's profit margin, even if you buy locally, has been stripped to almost nothing compared to what it would have been, due to competition from your favourite tax dodging multinational. So that's more money sucked out of the UK economy.\n\nBasically the wealth gaps between owners and workers have grown to such an extent that we no longer see significant productivity gains from tech. And people rich and poor spending every spare penny on property, either investing or renting/buying, is putting money into non-productive assets. But this is entirely counter-productive even for the wealthy in the long run.",

While it has increased our GDP, has it made our lives better?\n* The same underlying economic output can show in GDP differently depending on how it was accounted. For example, if you split a company in two and now they're doing a lot of external transactions that were previously internal, your \"GDP\" has increased. This means cycles of vertical integration and selling off can have material impact on GDP, and the driver of those is often tax policy. Reduce taxes, vertical integration becomes less advantageous, and now you have more visible transactions contributing to GDP, even though the work being done hasn't changed. A measure that is so vulnerable to small perturbations in tax policy isn't a good measure.\n* From 2007-2023, US GDP growth is reporting about 68%, whereas the UK is 6%. Is that really believable? Either that the US productivity growth has been about 10x what ours has been, or that our productivity has barely increased by more than a rounding error during the entire digital revolution? I've spent a lot of time in both countries and unless there's one hyper-productive guy pulling up the US average that I haven't met, I don't think it's believable that their productivity has increased *that* much more than ours. A bit more, sure, but not that much. More likely it's to do with financialisation, government spending, the petrodollar/global reserve currency, and big tech speculation.\n* Is a 24\" CRT that costs 1500 GBP better than a 55\" OLED that costs 800 GBP? Because GDP thinks it is.\n* In terms of goods, we live in an era of excess, basically. With food, for example, we have more of it  than we know what to do with, and it requires so little human effort to produce it.  If we were to decide that you know what we can all live just as well working 4 days a week, we'd still have way more stuff than we did in Y2K, but our GDP is going to go down to the level it was back then - if not lower.\n\nI've no idea whether rising NMW will increase productivity. There are arguments on both sides, and it probably has a marginal impact either way. But I just think we need to at some point move on from GDP as the be-all-and-end-all measure.",

That's why it is called product, i.e. things produced.\n\nGDP is also measured using three distinct approaches: output, income, and expenditure. The three approaches are aligned so that we know we are measuring the true GDP. So your split company example will not work as the two companies will have the same profit together as the single company.\n\nHave a look at the [Gross domestic product (GDP) QMI](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/methodologies/grossdomesticproductgdpqmi) from the ONS.\n\n> GDP estimates use three approaches, which are theoretically equal:\n>\n> output (or production) - the output approach to measuring gross domestic product (GDP) involves estimating production activity within the UK economy\n>\n> expenditure - the expenditure approach is the sum of all final expenditures within the economy, that is, all expenditure on goods and services that are not used up or transformed in the production process\n>\n> income - the income approach adds up all income generated by production in the form of gross operating surplus (profits), compensation of employees (CoE) (income from employment), mixed income (self-employment income) and taxes on products and production less subsidies for the whole economy\n\nThe higher GDP growth in the US is concentrated in three regions: New York, Silicon Valley, and Seattle. So indeed there are a bunch of people who are pulling the average up.",

                      "body": "It doesn't include asset prices directly, however it does include a whole load of things that are indirectly inflated because of asset prices - notably rent, but also a load of ancillary services, so in reality real estate asset inflation does significantly affect GDP. Meanwhile, GDP also doesn't include a load of indirect costs, but that's another topic.\n\nWith the split company thing, what I was originally trying to say was getting too long and I oversimplified to the point it didn't really make much sense any more. I was trying to get at how intangible assets are materialised when you create transactions, for example IP being sold to a holding company then licensed back rather than just being accounted for in the stock value of the company. Theoretically GDP hasn't increased as you say, because the production had occurred either way, but previously it would probably have been part of the dark GDP that statistical bodies almost never manage to capture. You could make the case that it all works out over the very long term when future income is accounted for, but in the short to medium term it creates cycles in the apparent measures of GDP that aren't actually meaningful, but are just due to speculation and policy changes affecting measurements. It's probably not the best example to use to illustrate it, since there are other more obvious cases where policy changes will cause apparent shifts in GDP which are really just measurement artefacts.\n\nAlso I'm aware that's where the GDP growth is supposedly coming from in the US, I just don't actually think it really reflects productivity by the plain meaning of the word. It's vulnerable to systemic bias (in either direction) that often make comparing the figures between economies less useful than it appears. \n\nNothing I'm saying is novel though. GDP is still a useful measure if you bear in mind its caveats, it's more that I have concerns about how obsessed our political-media class is with our quarterly GDP estimates, isolated from all other context. Is any other country so obsessed with GDP as we are? American politics, for example almost never talks about it. We seem to have Goodharted the hell out of GDP.\n\n(That's not to say I think the theoretical \"real\" UK productivity is doing well either.)",

And that is linked to the phenomenon we undoubtedly do see where labour force participation is eroding as more people go on the sick rather than working in lower-end jobs.\n\nBehind this is the fundamental point that productivity ultimately drives wages. You can’t just magic up wages and living standards out of legislation and nothing else. It has to come from the output of goods and services we all (or some of us!) contribute to the economy. Over time, we can only consume what we produce. \n\nSo if you want to raise wages for everyone, and not just compress living standards between the bottom and the middle, then you need to focus on boosting productivity and not policies like the minimum wage.",

Since the announcement of the wage bracket going up, all I've heard about it is companies complaining *endlessly* about how they'll have to pay higher wages and how bad for business it is and wah wah *fucking waaah*. \n\nRetail workers are *already* overworked and underpaid, so what's new? What precisely changes for them? Retail chains will tighten their belts and make employee's lives more difficult or flat out remove benefits to cost balance the increase in wages. I'd wager the overwhelming majority of people on minimum wage, myself included, haven't seen a non-governmental decreed wage increase since 2008. \n\nSo why should people work harder for the same effective take-home pay, while employer profits are still skyrocketing.",

There's a reason the book Bullshit Jobs resonated with so many people. \n\nThe world of work is not in a good place. And a lot of the reasons for that go beyond earning. I did a law degree, and in my third year realised that becoming a lawyer in the UK...is not a healthy path (unless you get lucky with a smaller firm somehow training you up). \n\nIt was clear to see after the career day when all the lawyers would get black out and look dead behind the eyes. But also clear once you mapped out the starting salaries to expected hours you needed to work. Loads of people literally say they are happy effectively giving up several years of their life to come out the other side. \n\nBut I just wanted to provide a bit of context as context is key to appraising individual jobs. And the person I responded to implied they'd studied to go into their job, so I'd guess they have some idea of the type of work \n\nHonestly I think in the world of work the UK has an issue with presentism and a lack of investment in training and tech. It's telling that some companies that have offered a reduced four day week report it does well...yet politicians and people still decry those companies like they're lying, or people get wound up because it might not work for literally every industry.\n\nAnd as others have pointed out, property is too expensive which causes all sorts of other issues in terms of financial strain.",

If the \"cost of living\" (not inflation, actual costs) was much lower, the NMW could be lower, business costs would be lower, and there'd naturally be more of a gap between skills.\n\nPersonally the way I look at the NMW is it's like low paid workers have a really good union in the sense that they've pushed for cost of living adjustments (albeit at the level where it's low / often requires benefits to subsidise low income employers...) and rather than employers decide that the NMW is too high, they'll go without, many have actually decided that they'd still rather pay for this low income work. I would suspect that *if* the NMW didn't exist, then on average low income workers would be paid less, as employers wouldn't have found a way to pay what they have to now.",

I'm sure the reality is far more grim for many people...\n\nFor example, Nursery costs increased sharply between 2019 and 2022. So I don't personally know anyone amongst my peers (in England at least) who was able to afford to have a 2nd child. I suppose the idea was to defer it for a few years until the day it was more affordable, which never came.\n\nBut I just checked to see what it costs *now* for the same nursery we used...\n\n5 days p/w = £1,673 p/m\n\nThat's approx **£400 p/m more** than we paid in 2022 **(23.9% increase)**\n\nSo to pay for 5 days at *that* nursery, now requires £20,076 take home pay = £25,500 gross\n\nFor some families, that might be most of, if not the entire, 2nd salary gone on nursery fees (particularly considering the 2nd earner might be part-time in such circumstances).\n\nNow start factoring disproportionately increased mortgage costs, council and water tax, fiscal drag, and so on and so forth.\n\nThen consider that, up until 4 years ago, highly motivated young people could go contracting for a few years and get money together for a house deposit etc. The government has also closed that door. And it will be a rarity for people in the working middle to be able to send their child to a Private School. All the doors have been closed.\n\nI've no idea how to measure all these factors, but I would summarize my point of view, by saying all of the working middle's options had *already been* taken away by 2021/2022 and now we are in the end-game, i.e. ultimately the working middle will be eroded entirely over the next 20 years.",

If the min wage keeps rising but higher pay rates don't many more people end up paid min wage. \n\nAnd this is about take home. If taxes and grad loans bring you below the min wage take home it's the same thing. \n\nAnd we should include childcare costs - if you don't want to end up in Children of Men.\n\nWhat it means is that after the govt takes its cut, after paying the overheads, the society cant get generate enough profit (surplus value) using skilled labour to justify the investment. \n\nWe become a low skilled society and reduce social complexity. \n\nThis is also shown in the fall in GDP per capita. We are getting poorer as a society.\n\nIt's the sort of reason why Rome could afford viaducts but mediaeval Europe could not. It's not that medievals didn't need or want such things, there was enough economic surplus to build it.\n\nWe aren't going back to the dark ages but it could get rough. But I don't think it's inevitable. I think a part of it was we assumed that govts can do what they like and society just runs anyway. But it doesn't and it can crumble. We are feeling that now.\n\nCompare our growth to the US and look at the wage differences especially with the currency differences.\n\nBut if your economy doesn't grow the govt will eventually tax everything not nailed down to get money it needs. The poor can't pay it as they have no money. The rich won't pay it as they will leave.\nSo it just devours the middle class, like I Argentina or Venezuela.\n\nOr it will print and the currency will collapse. Or the markets will doubt it's ability to pay debt and the currency will collapse.\n\nThe poor have no savings, the rich will have theirs elsewhere so the currency collapse just eats the savings of the middle class. \n\nExcept it's not a collapse, it's a discovery. The wealth your savings was a token of already went. It's just now you found out about it.",

              "body": "The impact is actually more insidious due to the shortage of housing.  Due to the lack of housing people are having to compete on price for the housing that is available on the market, putting ever more of their income into that endeavour.\n\nIncreasing minimum wage will put more upwards pressure on rent, which will transfer more wealth from those who do not have the capital to invest in property to those who do.  Meanwhile inflation will be driven higher, which alongside wage compression will trap more people into that situation of not having the capital to invest in property whilst their living standards decline.  Economic growth will slow further as inflation, lack of consumer confidence, increased business costs, etc. all take their toll.\n\nLowering levels of taxation or increasing minimum wage beyond inflation worsen our economic outlook whilst the underlying problem of not having enough housing remains unaddressed.  This is a problem going back decades that successive governments have failed to address, and for which Labour have unambitious plans that will likely fail to hit even the inadequate targets they've set, whilst net migration continues to apply ever more pressure on the housing stock we do have.  \n\nBuilding hundreds of thousands more houses than we currently do each year should be the number one priority for the government, yet they're tinkering around the edges of planning reform whilst pushing up labour costs and doing nothing to address the materials shortages and lack of skilled labourers.  Addressing our mortgage lender's aversion to prefab housing also doesn't appear to be on their radar, hindering growth in that sector with the benefits it would bring.\n\nAs sympathetic as I am to those on the minimum wage, this isn't the right way of addressing their plight.",

Seems absolutely precise in the sense that min wage helps pull up the ladder between asset-holders and aspiring middle class. Further encourages foreign investment in asset portfolios. Bloats the property market to further speculative insider trading.\n\n\nEconomic growth will increase alongside inflation, immigration will hold per capita growth stagnant. \n\n\nImmigration and enclaves will turn social housing into the most corrupt bureaucratic nightmare in England, and council taxes will become a fiendish problem for divided communities.\n\n\nMinimum wage will increasingly present itself as a backdoor UBI, only pegged to servile labour.\n\n\n- best way to fight housing costs would be to launch fierce building schemes in the cheapest areas of England, alongside barebones infrastructure investment. Let the viciousness of the housing market wrestle with itself by forcing more and more aspirational buyers to set up shop in less costly areas and force business development or otherwise die in rent payments. You could even play the high-cost rent environments up further to snap the current hold they have over aspiring renters, buyers.",

What will happen materially is that more of the lowest income people would own houses and less landlords would own houses. More people owning their homes => cheaper rent => landlords sell houses => even more people owning their own home => landlords reinvest in actually productive assets like UK stocks and bonds. Raising people's discretionary income and taxing landlords are the best ways to induce this. The idea that we have to suppress wages to prevent housing inflation is just ridiculous.",

I'd say the role is one that requires far above minimum wage.\n\n\n\nIt's not about \"being caught up to\", it's that the gap is closing.\n\nThe analysts and grade or two above have seen very real wage stagnation, in part it's an in industry problem. But wage compression has happened to all levels, just minimum wage has actually suffered the least as it's the only one that has seen consistent uptick, whereas private for the last 5 years has rarely seen payrises and before that they were typically below inflation. \n\n\nThe death of most unions has enabled corporations to stagnate pay in the face of increasing cost of living",

If they don't increase those roles then minimum wage wouldn't be moving.\n\nThis problem has essentially arisen from a specific choice to increase minimum wage to 70% in the first place. It's hard for employers that hire a lot of people between minimum wage and median wage to offer meaningful pay progression now and it's squeezed their budgets that allow previously allows for stratification.",

They’ve just made a decision without consulting leadership first and it’s incorrect and going to lead to pissed off staff and people leaving.\n\nWe have staff on hourly wages who are and have been for 5 years paid well above the min wage to r recognise their responsibilities and value - we made a choice as a company to do so and it really boosts retention.\n\nNow they’ve signed off those people on just the inflation metric which means they are getting a tiny raise in comparison and the staff under them on min wage or just above are seeing huge wage increases which now cuts down the difference.\n\nI’m not saying the min wage is a bad idea, but not matching it up the ladder is poor form and not what we expected to have to deal with previously and is a slap in the face of the staff.\n\nWe’ve effectively said this April you are worth less than last year.\n\nHowever the bigger issue is the huge price increase we will see especially in hospitality places that pay min wage for example. In some cases a £1 or so more per staff per hour will hit some harder than others. \n\nAnd then the money gained is lost to begin with as costs just increase. It’s also going to shaft younger hires - why hire younger when previously they were (rightly or wrongly) paid a lot less than an adult - primarily because you expect the older adult to have expect and maturity - and it helps get younger people into the work force. (Yeah I’d also agree it was effectively cheap labour).\n\nBut it was a big backbone of some industries and the way it’s been for decades. We are making fundamental shifts that morally might be correct but are going to have serious knock on effects.\n\nI’m not sure I agree this helps with the ‘cost of living’ most businesses if not all will look at the payroll increase look at the national increase and say well we need to increase prices.

          "body": "So my unpopular opinion: Min wage is a major contributor to housing price increases, inflationary pressures and squeeze on lower/middle income earners.  It actually fails to achieve what it is meant to by effectively making the vast majority of people poorer, especially at the bottom end of the income spectrum as more people get caught up in it or get ever closer.\n\nWhen the min wage was brought in, it only actually affected about 0.5million people.  That number has now jumped to over 2million possibly as high as 2.5million right now. This is because min wage has risen much faster than average wage growth and at an above inflation level since its inception. It is estimated that by 2030 over 4million will be on nat min wage. \n\nThis has had significant effects on the labour market, but most notably: 1. It has meant that money avalable for pay increases has been disproportionately funnelled toward min wage workers, resulting in smaller icnreases for lower paid (but not min wage) workers.  This effect is now so pronounced that even jobs that might have been considered semi skilled 20 years ago are now gettign close to being min wage. This results in alot of people being and feeling poor/er than they should be. 2. It results in inflationary pressure as costs of labor increase, makeing goods and services more expensive which just compounds people being/feeling poor/er, expecially at lower income levels. And 3. It directly contributes to housing inflation. Ultimately, because of the supply shortage of housing, landlords are going to charge the maximum (or close to it) they are able to charge.  By increasing min wage so far over inflation, landlords have been able to increase rents the most at the bottom end of the spectrum, which ripples upwards, increasing rents across the board, which then increases house prices as renting becomes more profitable. Therefore even though nat min wage has increased, housing cost increases effectively offset this, making everyone yet again be/feel poor/er.  \n\nTLDR: Nat min wage needs to stop increasing at above inflation levels and go back to being a true minimum wage.",

          "body": "The minimum wage effectively prices the least productive people out of employment. If an employer can’t turn a profit on someone whose productivity falls below a legally mandated threshold, they simply won’t hire them, or else they’ll find ways to sidestep the law. While some argue that “studies show minimal impacts on overall employment,” those figures tend to gloss over what happens at the margins, where the youngest, least skilled, or otherwise disadvantaged workers get shut out of the job market altogether. The fact that a broad statistical average doesn’t crater doesn’t help the individual who can’t break into that first rung on the career ladder because his productivity can’t justify the artificially inflated wage.\n\nThose people, already struggling to offer what employers now demand, find themselves with nowhere to go but onto public assistance or into under-the-table work. Minimum wage laws and employment regulations, in this sense, end up shackling both employees and employers, preventing them from freely agreeing on terms that reflect actual abilities and constraints. By disrupting that fundamental freedom to negotiate, we create a class of individuals who become institutionalized into living off benefits or drawn to illegal enterprises. Unregulated trades like drug dealing or prostitution don’t ask for a résumé or insist on a government-approved pay floor, so it’s hardly surprising that many turn there when formal avenues are legally closed off.\n\nPut bluntly: you can’t conjure higher productivity by passing a wage law. But you can raise the barrier to entry so high that those with limited skills are all but banned from the labor force, then act surprised when many resort to undesirable alternatives or end up trapped on welfare.",

                          "body": "It's still *at best* a huge misrepresentation, even if we assume that he's just an idiot rather than a liar (he could well be both).\n\nWhat I believe he is quoting is the total number of main applicant visas and dependent visas from that nation. Those dependents aren't necessarily attached to *those* main applicants, so his claim that 1063 main applicants brought 10670 dependents is, to be blunt, complete horseshit.\n\nYou can see a pretty good breakdown of what actually happened if you go take a look at the visa issuance stats:\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/monthly-entry-clearance-visa-applications/monthly-monitoring-of-entry-clearance-visa-applications\n\n1- UK gov releases the health and social care visa to try to get ahead of damage done to the health sector from Brexit. They implement something that's uncharacteristically easy to get, and there is little oversight of the roles. It is vastly easier to get than a skilled worker visa, and becomes arguably the main driver (along with the largely temporary impact of the grad visa) of the spike in net migration seen in 2022/3 (just look at the graphs).\n\n2- The government [implements basic checks on which organisations can sponsor care workers](https://www.nhsemployers.org/articles/impacts-changes-uk-immigration-policy) and bans new applicants from bringing dependents. The number of main applicants falls by over 80% and the number of dependents falls much further.\n\nNow, bear in mind that while new applicants were banned from bringing dependents, existing applicants could have their family join them, so there's a significant lag effect whereby the number of main applicants had already fallen in early 2024 but the number of dependent applicants took another few months to come down.\n\nAgain, [look at the visa issuance stats](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/monthly-entry-clearance-visa-applications/monthly-monitoring-of-entry-clearance-visa-applications) and that is very obvious.\n\nThis is of course the period Karl Williams felt was most pertinent to use to come up with a statistic to misrepresent for this, leading me to think that perhaps he is more of a liar than a moron, but he is certainly one or the other, if not both.",

Also want to add that as dependents were to be banned in March 2024, there was likely a big push to get their applications in before the deadline. So people who had received a health/care visa at any point were ensuring their dependents were applied for before March, further contributing to this outlier number.",

Those changes resulted in the [absolutely enormous](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/monthly-entry-clearance-visa-applications/monthly-monitoring-of-entry-clearance-visa-applications) drop in immigration seen in early 2024.",

So obvious that I’m confident this guy knows exactly what’s happened here and chose his “first six months of 2024” window very carefully.\n\nFirst, yes it is true. In 2024H1 we brought 1,063 health and social care workers into the UK from Zimbabwe, and we granted 10,670 dependent visas.\n\nIf you look back to 2023 though it’s obvious why. Dependents don’t necessarily arrive at the same time as the main applicant.\n\nPeriod | Main Applicants | Dependents\n:-- | :-- | :--\n2023 Q1 | 6494 | 5211 \n2023 Q2 | 4717 | 5116\n2023 Q3 | 4875 | 6831\n2023 Q4 | 2641 | 7741\n2024 Q1 | 758 | 8475\n2024 Q2 | 305 | 2915\n2024 Q3 | 451 | 1772\n\nMain applicant visas dropped dramatically at the start of 2024 with the new visa rules, but dependent visas didn’t start to drop until Q2 (and based on the numbers I’m betting are still largely under the old rules).\n\nBasically, the only way you could come to the “10 dependents” conclusion is to cherry pick exactly 2024 Q1 and Q2. \n\nI’m going to assume he’s not so stupid that he looked at those figures and thought “wow, the only explanation is that Zimbabweans have suddenly started bringing 10x more dependents in”.\n\nSo instead I’ll credit him with deliberately misrepresenting the facts in order to stir up ethnic hatred, he can fuck right off.",

Since the changes under Boris Johnson it basically meant all doctors in the entire world could apply to the UK with comparative easy (just a simple medical test that even a stupid medical student could pass and a basic English language test). This has opened the floodgates and meant very poor quality doctors from all around the world with questionable degrees are flooding in while at the same time doctors with years of experience in the NHS who have gone to the best universities and have been trained by this country for years with lots of NHS experience can't get a job. \n\nIf you list an advert for a job for a doctor, within about an hour it will thousands of applicants.

Neither the BMU nor the Royal Collega of Surgeon or anyone else actually invovled in the provision of medical care.\n\nThe issue according to them is two fold - One: a lack of funding means there simply are not enough jobs for the number of med students qualifiying. Its not that these jobs are going to immigrants. In fact the law specifically states immigrants cannot be prioritised over native students.\n\nTwo: they changed the allocation system (for which region you are assinged to) this years from a merit based allocation to some sort of algorithmic system meant to reduce biases against disadvantaged students. By all accounts, it has been implemented in the most shambolic way possible and this is causing lots of delays in med-students being allocated to foundation school regions. Note that, in almost all cases, they will be assigned and therefore get jobs, its just that they are not being told where they will be until very short notice (sometimes 3 weeks or less).\n\nNow that situation is obviously bad and should be fixed. But whatever this guy rambling on about \"poor quality\" foreign junior doctors coming over here taking med-student jobs is not the issue. At least, its not the issue anyone associated with the medical profession seems to be blaming.",

I am complaining because it is having an immensely destructive effect on the medicine practiced in this country and the quality of care patients are getting in when large numbers of incompetent people are being recruited ahead of those more qualified. \n\nIf you knew about medical recruitment procedures you would know that these are to all extents and purposes practically random. This is not the extensive kind of deep recruitment that private sector does to find the right person. This is not about winning the jobs, it's basically a lottery when you apply whether or not you will get the job. And in some cases for very early career doctors, it is quite literally a lottery - as in they will get all the candidates, and just randomly assort them to various parts of the country wherever they are needed.

There is no shortage of FY1 doctors, in fact in most years NHSE has to create more jobs because there are so many applicants. There is no point whatsoever in just increasing the number of medical school places, it won't actually help the NHS/cut the waiting lists/see patients any quicker - because the decision makers in healthcare are ultimately consultants.\n\nThere is a massive bottleneck for the jobs required to progress to consultants, so by having large number of medical students become early career doctors but then getting stuck you aren't actually solving any problem, just creating a downstream bottleneck at huge expense.",

Over two years, each applicant brought in 1.7 dependants, not 10. The reason for the disparity in early 2024 is presumably because of a much higher than usual intake in 2023 which sharply drops in 2024. Those people who arrived in 2023 bring in their dependants after arriving. The number of dependants also sharply drops off in Q3 and Q4 2024.",

If that trend continued, I'd only pay back £18,000 in 30 years and they'd be losing money. Not to mention all the interest I haven't paid back.

The government has to borrow money to pay us our loans and then the interest rate the government pays is apparently high or exceeds the amount that we pay in interest. So the government is actually making a loss on student loans.\n\nThe whole system is built on quicksand and is totally unaffordable. There needs to be genuine major reform of the sector, but like social care no one seems to want to touch it.\n\nI can’t find the article that explains this well, but the IFS has a short guide on the implications for student loans on government finances https://ifs.org.uk/articles/student-loans-england-explained-and-options-reform",

Because whilst the payment may be relatively high, it is at least once-and-done, not a lifetime garnish on your wages. \n\n9% of lifetime income above the threshold is simply not a good deal for a degree education if your income is high, but it can be a fantastic deal if your income is low.\n\nThere seems to be this perception that the state can just farm people for money at will like indentured labour, but that really doesn’t work well with highly discretionary decisions like taking a university course. The money will simply dry up. I’m assuming you’re not going to build an educational Berlin Wall to keep those undergraduates in.",

                      "body": "Sort of. It's irrelevant to the average earning graduate and those who earn less, but will bite anyone to the right of the bell curve with increasing ferocity. \n\nEveryone's circumstances will be different because of what Student Plan number they were on and how much maintenance loan they took out. I think I took on about £38,000 debt for my undergraduate (which is fairly low as I qualified for maximum grant at the time (2012-2015). I would have to clear just over £100 a month in repayments in order to repay just the capital within my 30 year period.\n\nThis means I would need to be currently earning around £41,000 a year - just to earn enough to repay the capital in 30 years. Salary sacrifice can stretch this out further too, so the more I put into the pension, the higher my earnings can be before hitting this threshold. As I currently earn a touch over this, I've researched a lot into how to avoid paying as much student loan interest as possible. \n\nThe average wage for a person with a degree is around £40,000. So at least those who earn the average wage will repay their loans in full with minimal interest - for the average graduate, the interest rate makes little tangible difference.\n\nThe more you earn above average though, the bigger the bite. Those on substantially higher wages, but that had to take full loans and/or will be paying back over 40 years under the current plan, face a much grimmer prospect. They will pay back far, far more than I will for the same education and access to the same (increasingly competitive) graduate job market.\n\nThe biggest threat to me personally is not the interest rate, but the repayment threshold and the brackets set for repayment proportional to income. In particular the latter as it scales harshly as you approach £40k in earnings and beyond. The government can (and has) made changes to these thresholds and have the power to do so retrospectively - for graduates this is the biggest actual problem with student loans and is frankly a travesty of justice. No commercial lender would be allowed to make such changes to a contract.",

If you make it so that hiring non-grads is cheaper then you screw over the graduates by making it harder for them to get a job. If you just make less graduates then you screw over the non-graduates for a long time until the system adjusts as they won't be able to get jobs.",

I was originally planning to go into academia, but was diagnosed with bipolar towards the end of my time at university and so had to not take it further than undergrad. I’ve spent a long time trying not to compare myself with people who didn’t spend time in third year in a psychiatric hospital, and reminding myself of my love for the subject and my enjoyment of it is one good way. \n\nI do hear what you’re saying but it isn’t that simple for me. In any case, English is great for analysis and interpretation skills, which has been very useful in my current job and elsewhere. I loved what I learnt of linguistics too. \n\nI’m very good at what I do. I’ve had to set my sights a little lower than the original plan, and I am trying to learn to be alright with that.",

You can say that those degrees aren't likely to lead to high paying careers, which is true, but because of how the loan is structured, for most the actual total amount of student debt doesn't matter. \n\nFor even basic entry level office jobs in most industries employers require a degree. Maybe you could work your way up without one, but it is certainly harder. \n\nGetting your foot in the door for a role with a middling salary may not make financial sense if you're looking at the total debt you've accrued (i.e. £40k+) - but since you only ever pay a set portion of that (and at the average salary in this country, it's barely a £100 a month), then the calculus is a bit different.",

Universities have been using subjects with low contact hours and international students to subsidise degrees which require expensive equipment like STEM when in reality not everyone can do STEM and we’d be stuffed without English teachers and soft power like films, books etc produced in the UK contribute vast sums to the economy. I’m a doctor and there’s no way my medical degree should cost so much as hospitals charge extortionate amount for placements and essentially pocket the money whilst providing us very little teaching. \n\nMy point is the whole system is wrong and student loans are a reflection of this. Why can European countries offer their students degrees at a much lower cost? Why is ours so over inflated? What needs to happen to make the higher education system sustainable in the longer term with likely decreasing native population? I don’t believe there are any easy solutions but to do nothing is to allow institutions to fall into ruin and students to shoulder unnecessary debt which is unpayable.",

                              "body": "It pretty much is life, yes. I made the mistake of not believing I could earn more or was worth more for quite a long time. I was always decently qualified, but I suffered from impostor syndrome and was terrified of rejection at interviews. I suspect, not judging, that perhaps you're also scared of rejection at interviews? This was me, definitely no judgement, and apologies if wrong.\n\nThe cold reality is that companies can reward loyalty, but you still have to have some internal leverage to force the reward. That means hints that you can get more elsewhere (not blatant, and don't piss people off). \n\nOr you make it explicit and interview elsewhere. Interviewing is a skill, and you only get better if you do it. \n\nI wish you luck.",

Later, when it got harder, I'd never learned how to put effort in, and things started to slip. I recovered a bit at university, because I loved what I studied.

                          "body": "It's really important when you're quoting such a document that you consider the entire paragraph, not just the bit that \"proves\" your point. Notably the following:\n\n>If 75% more 15-year-olds in forty-six of the world’s poorest countries were to reach the lowest OECD benchmark for mathematics, economic growth could improve by 2.1% from its baseline and 104 million people could be lifted out of extreme poverty (UNESCO 2012).\n\nSo in the case of the 46 poorest countries in the world, if they reached the lowest possible level of OECD benchmarks for mathematics, then we see a 2.1% increase in productivity. Wild, really, how much you can do in extremely poor countries with education. Shame, too, that it doesn't apply in the slightest to the UK.\n\nEducation is also multi-faceted. Worthwhile to note that the OECD also hugely advocates for apprenticeships.\n\nSure, if something is free, nobody is going to complain. Let's consider for a second a circumstance where food is free. Does that mean we'd all be ridiculously rich because nobody has to pay for food ever again? No. Does it mean that we'd all splurge on fillet steak and lamb shanks every night? Probably. Should we? Almost certainly not. Silly argument, pointlessly made and pointlessly answered.\n\nFrom an economic standpoint, education is a sound investment, to a degree. The thing which you're completely overlooking is that education doesn't mean a degree, it means education. There are on-the-job qualifications available which are vastly superior in terms of productivity than degree education, as above.\n\nEducation in the case of universities is also not a tax. It's a service being provided for a fee. Why? Because the alternative is similarly orchestrated. My employer, to take one example, pays a substantial fee to put apprentice recruits through the Makers Academy. We then pay the apprentices £32k per year during that 3 month course, and for the following 2 years as they round out the apprenticeship. Why? Because it's extortionately more profitable than hiring graduates - to be a software engineer in a cutting edge industry, we have far more success with private apprenticeship schemes than we ever saw with graduates (although we do also run graduate programmes, they are mostly pretty quiet nowadays as a consequence of us finding something better).\n\nThat being said, you're talking about what... £10k a year for tuition fees? Throw in rent, food, etc, and you're probably looking at £20k a year. I don't have the numbers to hand, but I'd expect we're paying upwards of £100k a year to **train** people through these apprenticeships, all told. There's a lot more return to be made in this market, and the most ridiculous thing about the whole situation is that all which needs to happen is that we ban the likes of McDonald's from running \"customer service\" apprenticeships and incentivise the apprenticeships which deliver real skills and value. It'd be a lot cheaper, trust me.\n\nThe lifetime costs are also not the only factor, there are also the lifetime benefits. Someone on one of our apprenticeships are *already* paying £4k a year in taxes. There are some tax breaks for the employer, but I guarantee you the state gets far more benefit from an apprentice in our system than a graduate in theirs.\n\nIf you don't want your grandkids to worry about student loans, have them look at alternative options. It may not be appealing work, but plumbers nowadays rarely earn less than £500 a day. Electricians in the right trade can easily break £600 a day. Software engineering is a traditional university course and £650 a day is a fairly common contractor rate. For these roles, nobody needs a university degree - just some GCSE mathematics skills to handle tax documents, an apprenticeship through a reputable firm (or a self-funded one, if you're inclined to cover the cost yourself - it's a lot cheaper than university), and a bit of savviness.\n\nFinally, whatta y'know, your very own document even contains this beautiful excerpt:\n\n>India’s rise onto the world economic stage is attributed by some to its decades-long successful efforts to provide high-quality, technically orientated HE to a significant number of its citizens Bloom et al. (2006).\n\nSo even they acknowledge that India's economic growth is attributed not to university education, but to \"technically oriented\" education.",

And you've no suspicions at all? Even after I point out the flaw in the interpretation?\n\nWe're not disputing here that education is an excellent return on investment. What we're debating is what form that education takes. In my opinion, university education is excessive and wasteful. In yours... I'm still entirely unsure, but your next paragraph may enlighten me.\n\nApprenticeships are bollocks. Ahhh, thanks for that refreshing sentiment. I'm shocked, I tell you, shocked. It may surprise you to hear that apprenticeships are not only an *alternative* to university education, but also an alternative to **college education**. The fact that university graduates end up looking for apprenticeships is direct demonstration of the failures of university education. It does not prepare people for work, in the vast majority of cases.\n\nSo it's a choice between 2 years of wholly state funded education, followed by 3 years of heavily subsidised education, vs 2 years of on-the-job training, in which the apprentice is not only paid a wage on which they pay tax, but during which another private entity is paid a substantial sum for the training. It's honestly not even comparable. The cost of apprenticeships is pitiful to the state compared to university education.\n\nYour assumptions are the biased ones here, not mine. I always try my best to see things from the other position, and I grant that some people do indeed learn better in a classroom setting - that's why I maintain that university has its place. Not only that, but it's a valuable asset for the very limited number of people who benefit from academia, and for the people their experience will benefit in turn.\n\nWhat exactly are you doing here? What's your angle? From what you've said so far, you consider apprenticeships to be an assault on graduates? Are you mad? Jealous? I can't tell exactly what it is, but something about your response is just ridiculous.",

Student loans are a vehicle to laden taxes on those seeking further education and are underpinned by the crabs in a bucket belief of \"what did you expect trying to make your life better\". \n\nGraduates at no point in history have ever been able to just \"do the job\". It's wild that any employer should have that expectation. \n\nI work daily with dozens of apprentices, hundreds across my site and they lack fundamental knowledge and skills that don't come from immediately going from school to an apprentice program. They need to be spoon fed daily, hand held, guided and directed LONGGG after they have finished their programmes. Their perspectives are limited and skill sets are narrow and they are beholden to minimum service requirements to pay back their apprenticeships to their employers.\n\nSo don't even have the experience of other organisations to bring to the table. They're the most lock stepped indoctrinated group going and if the organisation has a shortcoming, every single one of them has that shortcoming because literally how else would they know? \n\nWork places are not educational institutions and as a society we lose the benefit of research and academia as a whole. \n\nAn apprentice will never be a Dr. And will never replace the work and benefits of a doctoral programme to an economy and the second you make that an economic choice the entire country loses out. \n\nYou don't understand that because you haven't been to university. Universities do So much more than just bachelors degrees. \n\nHalf of the companies I have worked at and helped grow were absolutely dependent on their growth from university research, laboratories and (paid for) research that allowed us to advance our business. \n\nWithout bachelor students funding those institutions, we as a country lose SO much. \n\nGraphene came from a UK university precisely because of this system. In fact I was going to go on a diatribe about how many things came out of UK university R&D but it would honestly take way too long. \n\nThe conservatives forcing Apprenticeships as the only viable economic route is going to cripple the prospects of the UK for decades and the tax burden they've laden onto university graduates will be the final nail. \n\nApprenticeships should not exist in their current form and selling them as a \"cheaper route because university is for wooly non-vocational degrees\" is what will make our future prosperity an impossibility.",

I don't think anyone needs to explain the value that a historian can bring to the table, however, it's not immediately exploitable for profit. \n\nBy describing and measuring a degree solely on its ability to create and fulfill a job with a title that matches the degree means that it is easier to remove funding, and increase barriers to entry for degrees that provide cultural, artistic, and not traditionally job related benefits to society. \n\nLife would be fucking miserable without music, film, art, and design. We'd be rudderless without an understanding of where we came from, without researching where humanity came from, and what shaped our country and the path humans are taking.

The pursuit of higher education simply for the fact that it is interesting to you should be possible and shouldn't come with _careerlong_ debts. \n\nAll of these tangential, non-vocational degrees are still valuable and the idea that the state supports highly graduates simply isn't true. A deep knowledge of mythology, classics and Latin could make you a great writer. It does not make you a lorry driver. \n\nA fundamental understanding of the history of fine art could make you a curator of exhibitions and help you put on tremendous public displays. It won't make you an administrative assistant. \n\nI genuinely believe the issue is that privately educated people hold this world view that the role of the state education system is to create workers. That the pursuit of other endeavours isn't the purpose of the state educated and that it shouldn't be \"paid for by them\". \n\nI'm not saying for a second everyone should study classics and interpretive dance. Just think of your school class and how diverse everyone's interests were back then. Not everyone _wants_ to do these things. \n\nI'm saying that it should be possible to pursue these endeavours and it should not be an economically motivated decision as the benefits of these degrees are not immediately apparent but still create economic growth in the long run and that as a society we are _all_ better off for it.",

There are various avenues this conversation could take, and they'd inevitably include things like the efficiency of farming, retail, logistics, public service maintenance, etc... The simple truth is that realistically, university should be available to somewhere around 20-30% of people.\n\nTo put it another way, the vast majority of degrees undertaken today are in industries where on the job training and apprenticeships are far better suited. It was an extremely Blairite policy to make university available to everyone.

But by 2023, the typical graduate earned only 1.6 times the salary of someone on the wage floor. And the lowest-earning graduates now earn only marginally more than full-time minimum wage workers: those at the 10^(th) percentile of earnings now have salaries just 11 per cent higher than someone on the wage floor, compared to 82 per cent higher back in 2001.\n\nSounds like the median, and yes a 'graduate job'",

As a higher and higher percentage of people go to University, that hurdle has gotten lower and lower.

For me and many others it seemed like we extended knowledge (that mostly would never be used), but skills, judgement and reasoning had little development.\n\nIn the end I stayed, accepted that I should buy the piece of paper that proves your smarts.\n\nI don't have kids yet, but I honestly don't know what I'd suggest to ambitious young people now.  The costs of uni are even higher, graduate market is flooded with diminished ROI.

Over the past 10 years the students have become incredibly entitled and dependent on the lecturers. They feel university is an extension of sixth form, it isn't. I love teaching people who are interested in the topic that I have pretty much given my life to, and I will  gladly give time to students who engage. On the other hand I have no tolerance for bullshitting, I just can't be bothered with it, I'm busy, if a student doesn't care I don't care about them. Luckily, I bring in a lot of grant money and because of this I can get away with being petulant about teaching.\n\nOne of the big problems with universities is that what get academics promoted for usually has little to do with teaching. I get little benefit from teaching, it is a time sponge. I get promoted by bringing money into the university and publishing in high ranking journals. This is why high ranking universities often have pretty mediocre teaching. I am not stupid, if I wanted to put a lot of time and effort into teaching I could. However, I want to earn more money so that I can give my kids a nicer life than I had.  Doing the best teaching I possibly could, runs against that!",

Some walked into decent paying jobs right off, but lots of people had a sort of training stage. That said, even during the training stage, pay was  it amazing but was above minimum wage by a reasonable amount and then rapidly was significantly above.

Tuition fees for a typical three-year course are £27,750 and will rise to £28,605 in the autumn.\n\n>The Resolution Foundation’s Labour Market Outlook report notes that there is now barely any difference between the lowest earning graduates and those on the minimum wage.\n\n>It says that graduates in the lowest 10th percentile of earnings now have salaries just 11 per cent higher than someone on the minimum wage. Graduate salaries were 82 per cent higher in 2001.\n\n\"University might be a waste of money because the lowest 10th percentile of earnings for graduate is only 11% higher than minimum wage\". That's an incredibly stupid argument, not only because you're only considering the bottom 10% of graduates but also because you're ignoring the opportunities and career trajectory for graduate roles which are almost always better than non-graduate roles.\n\nThis article should really be titled \"the worst graduates don't do much better than people on minimum wage\", which shouldn't be surprising for anyone",

This isn’t meant to demonise people on minimum wage but when you went from the salary being miles above MW to barely above it you do question the value of a degree. It won’t be long until that £28k is the minimum wage and at that point your pay-rises will be determined by Gov actions and not your employer. £28k also means paying back student loans too so you are in fact being paid less as you get caught up by minimum wage workers.",

Mean and median household disposable income are at all time highs in real terms, although haven't shifted much in 10 years.\n\nThe net result of this whole change is that the lowest earners in the workforce are more capable than they've ever been of sustaining a reasonable quality of life, whilst the middle-tier earners in the country are as capable as they've been for the last decade and a bit of sustaining a good quality of life.\n\nIf your complaint is that poor people are less poor, that's very much a you problem. Even if you interpret this as poor people are less poor *because* of your own wage stagnation, you might have a point but I still don't think it's worth paying attention to. If your complaint is that some magic hasn't happened to make a mediocre line of work you're in pay well enough to buy you a rolls royce, well that's also on you.",

New Labour's *Education Education Education* policy inevitably devalued apprenticeships, contributing to the housing crisis via increased construction costs. University became merely an extension of 6th form and degrees were subsequently devalued forcing graduates to chase a questionable master's degree or PhD in order to distinguish themselves. Nearly all sweeping centralised policies like this lead to unforeseen consequences.\n\nToday's academia has so many failings - it actively encourages group think with the most independent thinkers and mavericks dropping out due to boredom or frustration. It promotes those who follow instructions to a fault, possessing zero imagination when it should be a hotbed of fresh ideas and innovation. Instead of being an educational institute it became a business selling a product that ignored industry and later developed into a cash cow reliant on training our competitors from rival countries like China and India.",

But the continued uprating of it, interacting with some of the oddities of the tax system, and flatlining productivity (which is probably endogenous to MW uprates) have definitely led to some really weird distortions in our labour market. Wage compression is really severe and the opportunity cost of effort is pretty high. \n\nWe've gone from having minimum wage at 40% of median wages in 2000 to 60% presently, thats one of the highest in the OECD - and by far the largest for a major economy.\n\nPoliticians (and the state), by and large, I think have been pretty stumped about how to manage the economy particularly since 2008 - and the MW is an 'easy' policy leaver you can crank to make marketable things like in-work poverty go down.

                  "body": "You are completely ignoring productivity though. Real wage increases are a function of increasing productivity. UK labour productivity has essentially flatlined since 2008, so no wage increases, but cost of goods and services continues to rise. \n\nThe problem with this though, is that causality of productivity flatlining / minimum wage increases is highly likely non-linear and bidirectional. You get productivity increases from better matching of employees to roles where they can be most productive or implementing better technologies / ways of doings things, more efficient processes etc. (which are all driven by those employees that you need to match efficiently). \n\nIf market wages aren't going up because productivity isn't going up, but on the lower bound wages are increasing because of MW uprates, then on the margin some proportion of workers are going to just downgrade themselves into lower paid work, because relative trade-off of them working longer and harder hours to get more pay is becoming worse off. This is just creating mismatches. It would be better off on a society level if those employees were in those original jobs rather than where they ended up. Because productivity increases are driven (partly) by those workers being in those jobs. \n\nAs I say, this effect gets even more severe when you consider the interaction with other policies - such as tax cliff edges (like for household £100k and child benefit). \n\nI have done this myself. My friends have done this. I have dropped out of high skill work in London to go elsewhere because the relative trade-off of me working there, getting a higher wage, but having to endure the disutility of significantly higher effort to work in that job just became stupid. It was an easier life to 'trade down', get paid less but enjoy the higher utility of a less stressful life. I am now 'mismatched' - my skills do not match my position. But, as I say, it would be better off on a society wide level if I hadn't done this. \n\nThe higher you keep raising MW, on the margin the wider and wider you cast that net, so you end up with more of this happening.\n\n>Surely if the minimum wage is catching-up with “middle” earner, ire should be directed at employers?\n\nThis is predicated on the idea that employers have some hidden war chest of money that they are sitting on that they can divert into wage increases for their employees. But this is laughable, because this hypothetical war chest isn't materialising in UK stock dividends, or corporate profitability margins, or in balance sheets.\n\nEdit: Honestly, this kind of belief, which you see really often on here (particularly from more left-leaning commenters) really fucks me off. It is viewing the economy not only as a collection of zero-sum interactions (which is incorrect itself), but its layering on some kind of morality tale-prism on top of it. If workers are getting a shit time of it (which, undoubtedly, they are) then it *necessarily* must be the case that employers are doing great. But not only that, for workers to be doing badly then there has to be blame assigned (obviously to employers/business). Its such an infantile way of looking at the world.\n\nBut that isn't the case. The UK, in global terms, is in the shitter and both UK workers and UK employers are doing awful.",

[...] ever more work is now devoted to zero-sum competition. Such an economy would increasingly be a very unequal one, with a small number earning enormous incomes. Paradoxically, the most physical thing of all – locationally desirable land – would dominate asset values, and rules on inheritance would be a key determinant of relative wealth.\"\n\nAnd ignoring the fact that within the economy are numerous zero sum sub-sectors (land being finite being the more famous or crucial one), on a macro scale money is always negative sum (dollars are outpaced by greater debts owed). Growth rates are never enough to offset this, as most wealth is captured by a few and as recursive re-lending creates multiple concurrent principal debts of the same money. So even a growing pie is effectively zero sum for the majority anyway.\n\nBeyond this you have the usual Cornucopian Fallacies: capitalism's longstanding assumption that peak energy sources, peak resources (minerals, clean top soil, aquifers, clean air, etc.), peak biodiversity (large fauna, pollinators, fish stocks, birds, etc.) don't constitute real bottlenecks. Essentially the illusion of a positive-sum via thefts from future generations.\n\nSo it's simply not true that \"everyone wins\". And you know this intuitively. The purchasing power of your dollar is dependent on the global majority being broke, and inflationary pressures would kick in if they weren't.",

Investors also aren't basing their investment decisions on a sense of loyalty due the UK's decent investment returns in years gone by.\n\nIn fact, they'd likely be fired for doing so, because they have a fiduciary duty to their investors (mostly people saving into workplace pensions etc.) to get the best return on capital; and with the free movement of capital in a modern economy, they can move that money overseas (e.g. to the US).\n\nFor the ultimate beneficiaries too, this doesn't make much sense, because the people who own shares change over time. Generally people hit peak savings just before retirement and decline from there, so you'd be expecting those in their 40-50s today, to pay for the good returns of those now in their 80s, who will've spent most of their savings already.\n\nLastly, in terms of that 1.5-2x figure you've quoted; that would be diabolically bad if true. I suspect it's higher once you throw in divvies (look up the FTSE100 total return for this), but over 20 years, it would imply a compound return of about 2.0-3.5% per annum. That's less than some cash savings accounts, which come with a govt. backed guarantee, for taking equity risk. No rational investor would put their capital in the UK, if they were told that was what they should expect.",

It's such a reddit way of looking at things.\n\nFTSE 100 companies are predominantly global businesses (BP, BAT, GSK, Rio Tinto, Unilever etc.). They have chosen to list in London, sometimes have an HQ in the UK (not always), but most of their shareholders, and often their customers are from elsewhere.\n\nThe idea that 'we' are paying them anything is quite funny, we're not. Their global shareholders are and it's up to them to decide how much they want to pay for talent.\n\nTheir performance hasn't been great but tbh that's a reflection of the sectors they're in: they're just mostly in the 'old economy' (e.g. O&G, mining, tobacco, insurance, etc.) which has grown a lot slower (and therefore had much lower returns) than US indices.\n\nThat delta is also reflected in much lower pay, with a US CEO (S&P 500) making on average 3x as much.\n\nOpen hostility to things like CEO pay, might seem noble but it (alongside other factors), makes London a less attractive place to list, and drives more of the financial industry (and all its tax revenue) across the pond to NY.\n\nIndeed, several British companies have already moved there and others are considering it. Shell's CEO for example, might seem well paid on £8m, but his close competitors at Chevron and Exxon make $27m and $37m respectively. Unsurprisingly, he's been thinking a lot about a New York listing.",

I've tried and failed to dredge up the specific NBER working paper I'm thinking of, but Robert J. Gordon has done some amazing work on this. The last chapter of his totemic book *The Rise and Fall of American Growth* deals very specifically with this - while obviously focused on the US, the stuff he talks about is generally applicable. \n\nConversely, it has flatlined in the UK - and pretty much the UK only. \n\nSo there is a general trend in productivity decline, which is likely linked to the fact that in the post-WW2 period we achieved all the 'quick wins' in productivity we could. For example, white goods (washing machines, microwaves, electric ovens, fridges) effectively freed up the entirety of the female half of the population to enter into the workforce - just think about how much combined labour manhours those innovations freed up. \n\nCompare that to these small innovations we've had in the IT-era. Is moving from Email -> Slack -> Teams/Zoom messaging that big of a productivity increase, particularly when compared to fax -> Email, or from physical delivery -> fax?

They've perfected the art of draining money from everyone and everything to go to a few select us elites.

Also the national living wage is irrelevant here because I was not discussing that. \n\nThe National Minimum Wage, introduced in 1999, had an immediate impact, raising pay for over 1.5 million workers. Contrary to fears such as how you are spreading, unemployment didn’t rise, and sectors like retail saw productivity gains. Household disposable income grew, boosting consumer spending and local economies. Over two decades, it also helped reduce in-work poverty and supported fairness, with evidence showing it narrowed the gender pay gap and raised living standards.",

You put people out of work with the minimum wage because they cannot get started not providing enough yet for an employer to take the risk.\n\nAlso why do we need a minimum wage increase?

I've never argued against the minimum age, only this absurd idea that it automatically protects workers. \n\nThe working time directive _protects_ workers. The HSE _protects_ workers. The Pensions Act _protects_ workers, as does the Equality Act. Raising minimum wage doesn't _protect_ workers, it just increases the price of labour - which notably doesn't help employment figures, working conditions, or under-paying exploited foreign workers. \n\n> cheap foreign labour are also covered by the minimum wage \n\nRight, because the black market and cash-in-hand gig economy definitely doesn't exist, all workers are legal and registered, and no-one ever pays in-kind goods and services that are worth a lot less than they're claimed to be. \n\nIf you want to protect British workers, then we should be enforcing visas and not handing out visas to everyone in the third world. Auto-enrolling workers into a pension scheme _immediately_ rather than after three months would be a good idea too. Raising the cost of employment through wages _and_ taxes at the same time isn't going to help anyone.",

A fresh lawyer isn't generally coming out of university - they generally have a couple of years of paralegal experience and two years of training underneath their belts, which pay just over minimum wage and anywhere from £30k-60k respectively (more is possible, but that's basically limited to MC firms). So a 'fresh lawyer' is actually a moderately experienced professional in any other field.",

In the 1970's, only 10% of people went to university.\n\nBut what if we train 50% of the population with 4+ year university degrees (as 50% go to university today).  Do we turn grocery store clerks into rocket scientists.  No we still need grocery store clerks and we already have rocket scientists.  What happens is we get people with rocket science degrees who work in grocery stores.\n\nAnd the pay of rocket scientists keeps dropping until it goes to whatever the legal minimum wage is because of the old supply and demand.",

That's not an issue, even if the Telegraph would like to paint it as one.\n\n\nThe issues are that employers are content to let graduate wages stagnate, and that previous Tory governments and the current Labour government have reneged on the idea that student loan repayments should only start to be repaid once you're earning a decent salary.\n\n\nThe repayment threshold for graduates who started their degrees in the 2023/2024 academic year is £25,000, which will be the minimum wage for a 40 hour week by this April. Meanwhile the postgraduate loan repayment threshold is just *£21,000*.\n\n\nWe need to either accept that this system is ridiculous and implement a fair graduate tax, or increase the repayment thresholds.",

I have many friends and even some family members who do it.\n\n\nI have a cousin who gets a decent amount of cash, a nice two bed apartment (she is one person) a car and even an extra allowance for a dog as it's her support animal. She's never worked a day in her life, spends most of her money on drinking and nonsensical shit like DVD's (yes new dvds in 2024). She was perfectly capable of working but has now damaged her liver due to partying too hard, too often, so is actually recovering now. But prior to that she was very happy to plead whatever mental health issue she could google. Meanwhile, my grandparents are reasonably well off, so would give her extra money for trips to Florida and Thailand with friends, which somehow didn't void her claims.\n\n\nAdditionally I have a friend who lives with her parents, a quite wealthy family. She stays in a second fully equipped properly adjacent to the large family house and claims benefits for rent, which her family doesn't actually make them pay. She gets any money she needs whenever she needs it and is occasionally working cash in hand on art and photography. Flat out refuses any real job as she's eventually going to make it big with her hobbies and jobs like working in a bar or retail are so demanding and would trigger her anxiety as it's far below what her family would expect of her after private school.\n\n\nThey live a lifestyle far wealthier than most people I know, their family have multiple houses around the world that they frequently invite me to, but sadly I almost never have time due to actually working and they consider their benefits money as pocket money. I'm sure at least part of their mental health struggles are real, but most people have some kind of anxiety or other issues yet still manage to work, as they simply need to.",

Outside of perhaps not declaring cash earnings, but I'm not sure if that's the case or not. It's not against the rules of being on benefits to have family members gift you things or pay certain bills for you as far as I'm aware. They might have the \"rent\" go into the right account legally, but just be sent back as a gift, who knows.\n\nTo my knowledge, you are not required to declare selling of personal hobbyist items (art, photography) as income unless you are registering as a business and doing it a bit more seriously or earning over a certain threshold. Selling the odd item for a hundred quid or so is no different to selling your old xbox on ebay for example.\n\nI could be completely mistaken here, but that's my understanding of the system at least as I've never had to be on benefits so don't quite know the limitations and just how grey the grey areas are. I also don't really think this is a thing that should be solved on the individual level, but rather at a legislative and policy level.",

Not including time when asleep, people with health issues making it not possible for them to do a job... work over 120hrs a week, so they get well under a 1/3rd minimum wage.  \nMore needs to be done to catch out those committing benefits fraud! Basically, spy on them! Catch them showing they are perfectly fit enough to work, people who spend much of their time smoking weed, which does cause serious behavioral problems, brain damage.... Such as one chap I had to visit, spend his life eating ridiculous amounts of junk food, smoking weed (which benefits paid for!) And gaming... But he was seen carrying a washing machine, a hugely heavy thing, yet apparently he was weak, and barely able to stand, with a chronic back problem... But, when he began bragging about using a soup kitchen... I reported him, which was not followed up. And sadly the washing machine thing was not recorded, so he got away with it all... about 10yrs ago, on benefits higher than my wage.  \nMany trapped on benefits live miserable lives, including major depression, which all too often leads to severe mental health problems, yet... they cannot get help, as so much has been channeled to those I do NOT see as worthy! Drug addicts. Peoples wages/taxes which go to benefits are paying for peoples drugs... that is where the laws need to change... Supplying drugs kills, so it should always be at least a charge of attempted murder. Buying is contributing to people dying... so the same charge. It would make a tough time, but after a while... there would be a FAR lesser drug problem, and far less crime over-all.  \nI'm semi-retired now, just do some work online... and travel! The UK has a massively bigger drug problem than countries I've been to in the last few years, which includes France, Spain, Turkey, Albania... and so on. The UK is a mess, and those who are unable to work, are suffering badly due to it.",

If you own a house outright with no mortgage, you are almost certainly wealthy enough to live off your savings for several years and so have no business getting other people to pay for your living expenses through the force of law.\n\nExample: Something like 30B pounds a year in state pension for elderly people with net worth over a million pounds is given out. This is a ridiculous use of taxation and cutting it would immediately shrink the government by about 3%, meaning we could e.g. cut national insurance levels by about one-sixth.\n\n  \n(You're right, it is political suicide, but I'm just making the argument that it's the right thing to do :D)",

It’s also subject to income tax alongside other taxable income. If you want to means test it then you’d have to look at reforming National Insurance and how it’s taxed.\n\nPIP isn’t a replacement for wages or income. It’s to counteract the additional costs that come with a health condition or disability. \n\nDifferent benefits serve different roles. Things like Universal Credit should be means tested based on other income because they ultimately serve to act as a replacement for wages for people out of work. PIP shouldn’t be tied to income because its not replacing income. The State Pension essentially just an incredibly generous pension scheme backed by the government.",

It's funded to the elderly each year by the income-earning population in the same year. There is no actual pension you are paying into or investments you are making when you pay your NI, which is at this point just an income tax with a different name.\n\nYes, PIP is designed for that purpose. But why should it be given to people who can afford to cover those costs themselves?",

Paying National Insurance guarantees your State Pension, even if it’s not funding it directly. \n\nIf you want to move the State Pension to a means-tested model, you either need to reduce or get rid of National Insurance, as anything else at that point is just a tax raid on the individual. \n\nAnd PIP arguably goes with the principle that in an equitable society someone shouldn’t be disadvantaged for being ill or disabled. So PIP cancels out the extra costs that come with additional mobility needs etc. you can argue the specifics of it but you also have to consider what the benefit is supposed to do/achieve at a fundamental level.",

Because I'd saved up/invested enough money that I was unable to have benefits, so I had to work, I guess you could say I was lucky. Generally speaking the only people doing these jobs are migrant workers, students and people like myself not eligible for benefits. I didn't want to dip into my long term savings.\n\nI would however add that if I'd had that capital in bricks and mortar instead of cash/investments, I could've rocked up at the jobcentre and got all the benefits under the sun AND see my house go up in value. I'm not exactly kicking myself over it, its just I never had enough saved to buy a decent house outright and going down the mortgage path wasn't an option because I had a lot of temp jobs, spend some years at uni etc.",

You don't get your mortgage paid. I did all the same things as you, all the same crappy jobs when I could work them, used it to save £28000 in a deposit in FT work. Maybe its because I am a bit older and bought a house in 2014 when the prices were low(er). \n\nYou don't know how your fortunes will change and lots of people getting disability payments are scarily skilled professionals who have been forced out of work on health grounds- I was a trainee psychologist who had worked as a teaching assistant for years. I know a trainee doctor and an accountant, but we all need so many adaptations for work now that there aren't any takers for us really. Even for minimum wage stuff. \n\nThe government aren't going to pay your mortgage though. You'd still need to pay for somewhere to live (and quite possibly be pushed into destitution for holding onto your assets).",

There is a natural incentive for everyone to make everything work.\n\nI'm thinking here of skilled tradespeople who normally deal directly with homeowners but maybe get hired for a few weeks to subcontract on a larger project but no-one knows exactly how long it will take or wants to waste time and money on employment paperwork. I could see the same kind of argument for people who do transport/logistics and have their own vehicle. And of course in creative industries and technology there are loads of freelancers or contractors brought on for specific projects.\n\nBut that's a very different situation to low-skilled or unskilled work where people getting hired are - from a business perspective - basically interchangeable cogs in a machine. If there isn't a lot of cost and effort involved in choosing who to hire and if the people you do hire aren't building up much accumulated value because of what they know and understand as they carry on with the job then it's a lot more important to protect the workers from being exploited in ways we might consider unfair compared to our traditional British employment model.",

I think the minimum is good primarily because it destroys unproductive businesses and this how it should really be thought – as a minimum productivity threshold for companies. If a business cannot reach this minimum threshold of productivity then it will fail. Often however it won't just close, but try to find ways to be more productive with technology. A good example of this might be McDonalds self-serve terminals.\n\nThe issue though is that while continuing to increase this minimum productivity threshold might encourage businesses to invest in their productivity, it cannot be increased infinitely. If businesses are already struggling they're not going to be able to invest in productivity and will instead fail. Ultimately we can't always expect minimum wage to result in productivity improvements especially when minimum wage is already increasing rapidly. Past a point costs will begin to be passed on to consumers in the form of inflation and where this isn't possible people will lose their jobs.\n\n> Where do shareholder dividends feature in your model?\n\nI'm not sure where you're going with this? Are you suggesting that shareholders could cut their dividends to offer higher wages to workers? Obviously this can and does happen, but people won't run a business if there's no financial reward in doing so. At a certain point if adequate profits can not be generated business owners will just close up the business.",

The minimum wage is not a measure of productivity - it’s the minimum amount deemed necessary to earn a living in the UK. _Average_ wages should track productivity/inflation.\n\n2. If you’re trying to explain real NMW growth, you can’t ignore the costs of housing as it’s a fundamental part of the concept of a _minimum_ wage.\n\nTaken as a whole, [actual economists say](https://www.economicsobservatory.com/are-wages-keeping-up-with-the-cost-of-living) broadly costs have been rising faster than wages for the last few years; which is naturally going to be more extreme for those on the lowest wages; hence why their growth will skew more than the _average_.",

It's all very well having those things administered by local councils, but the funding for them should not come from the local authority directly. By failing to account for population and demographic change since the funding was cut, it has created an inevitable crisis where councils have no money to do anything except  those legally required services. In many cases they can't even do that without resorting to emergency funding requests from central government because they are effectively bankrupt.\n\nThe problem with that is that all the other stuff which gets cancelled are all the visible things that people expect their local authority to do - bins, road maintenance, libraries, parks and amenities, street sweeping etc. It's all being cut to the bone with a tangible impact on how places feel. Everything feels run down because there is no money to do anything.",

That includes council taxes. And when council taxes go up (as they do every year), so too will their expenses claim.\n\nIf any of the Telegraph's furious readers have their second home as part of an employer benefit, they can expect the same treatment I'm sure.

There it's totally justified to have two homes, but they're unique.\n\nIn my previous role I had two offices that were 200 miles apart, and the geographic split meant it was a challenge to spend time in the remote office.

And that before we consider the difference between governance and private buissness.\n\nI think you'd be surprised how many businesses have more than one location and that directors often have to split their time between two or three locations.\n\nNot every MP is in Shetland or Northern Scotland so that's a complete straw man.  An MP in Woking gets the same perks despite being 30 mins from London by train.\n\n> Alot of the time sure not this time. Ok mps are NOT saying that. So theres two parts to this firstly this is not a descion by mps IPSA made the choice to put the funding into this to cover the second homes charge not mps. \n\nMPs are saying that as it is the MPs who have awarded themselves different tax treatment on such expenses being paid for them.  An employee with a business paying utility bills on their behalf because they have a second home will incur National Insurance.  If the business covers their council tax they'll pay NI and PAYE on the amount.  MPs get both covered tax free.\n\n> Secondly this is not saying theres not legitmate reason to have second homes its saying ok if you want a second home you need to give us some money\n\nMPs have changed the rules to allow councils to make these charges as a punitive measure on those with second homes.\n\n> The distance between london and all of Scotland is over 100 miles longer than the distances between your two offices from what I found. And Shetland to London is something like 600 miles. So that shows imo how far some mps have to travel and some of the difference.\n\nAgain the *potential* distance is a straw man, as it's not universally true for all MPs and applies equally to MPs within the commuter belt, and has no bearing on the tax treatment for employees.  If I had a factory in Singapore then the rules don't change for me based on distance.\n\n> And I think mps should have costs related to the job of running the country paid somewhat as those costs are down to the running of it\n\nYou're now arguing against something I never said.  I believe MPs should have the costs related to the job covered, I do not believe they should be able to profit from it by owning second homes that have their running costs covered, and I do not believe they should receive special treatment in law beyond those specifically needed to carry out their job.",

Thats not comparable to living at once site for five days sometimes from scotland to london and then going back to the other.\n> \n> It is likely fairly unique in that not many others live the distances apart between the two sites and for the length of time mps often do.\n\nHere's [the bell curve](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Distance-distribution-of-commuting-trips_fig2_311458920).  So taking the census data as most likely to be accurate it's ~0.7% of the workforce who commute more than 200km.  There are approx 34m employed in the UK, so that's ~238,000 people.\n\nNow that's not a perfectly analogous data set but as far as I can tell we don't have one to answer our exact needs.  People travel for work more than you think, and many of those will be primarily between two locations.\n\n> And a whole countries mps live over a hundred miles further than that… and alot of mps live far away even if a majority dont alot do enough for the system to be done this way.\n\nThen have a two tiered system.  Why do you think it's optimal to apply this equally to all MPs?\n\n> If you read the article it says ipsa is payog the money for this surcharge not that mps arent taxed. And regardless HRMC guidance isnt a mp descion more a gov one which may at best have a cabinet of like under 20 mps deciding but maybe only one mp or even a lord.\n\n> Except this case the mps would have to pay the tax but ipsa is paying the money\n\nThat's what this article is about, there is wider context in the tax treatment of expenses.\n\nIf you work for a private business then you are [taxed on accommodation and other expenses](https://www.gov.uk/expenses-and-benefits-accommodation/what-to-report-and-pay).  \n\nIf you're an MP then as per [section 3 here](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/668bffa2d9d35187868f4667/11229_Tax_and_NICs_Guide_Ministers_KJ_v2_20240705.pdf) your accommodation expenses are not taxed.\n\nSo IPSA is covering the council tax and no NI or income tax is levied on that figure.  If a private business did the same for a worker or director then both NI and PAYE income tax would apply.  MPs are not in the same boat.",

Essentially, rentals have to lose the owner money (through taxation), otherwise they're still worth buying. It's not enough to strongly tax profits, as landlords would still buy them if the profit-cost was break even as the house goes up in value over time. It would have to be a high tax on profits + additional taxes like a LVT that's not deductible from profits.",

The one I quoted was basically ONS's truly vacant data, though that's a mess because the last census was in the middle of Covid.\n\nE: [There's a helpful map here where you can look at % of second homes by council area](https://www.mylondon.news/news/property/london-borough-number-second-homes-30419974). There's a few boroughs in London which have high percentages, but most Boroughs are essentially fully occupied - e.g. Islington has 1 in 485 homes being second homes, Brent has 1 in 716, Lambeth 1 in 245.

That seems like a problem that might sort itself out in time.  If the empty homes are unaffordable then it's because they are overvalued now.  That's going to be a very painful pill to swallow for people who bought these second homes but I would guess over time they are going to have to bite the bullet and take the loss.\n\nIt sounds like it could be a painful time for many but this is probably what needs to happen over the long term so that people can afford to live in the area they are from.",

You would think that was a good starter flat.”\n\n> David adds: “We’ve had people on our case about all the local people we are forcing out – well, they are not forcing their way back in.”\n\n“We contributed to driving up prices and forcing people to move away, and now we are absolutely baffled that there’s fewer locals looking/able to buy”\n\n> And the sad thing is there is a whole network of electricians, plumbers, cleaners who all earn income off [second home owners]. They are the ones who are going to suffer as well.”\n\nFamously electricians, plumbers and cleaners are only employed by second home owners.",

Demand for these properties is very low – from both locals and other would-be second home owners.\n\n>“These houses are standing empty and they are not suitable as main homes,” she says. “They might look like perfect chocolate box cottages but they are hard to heat and in the winter, that’s not practical for a young family.”\n\nWow.

              "body": "Landlords serve a purpose. We can't all just leave home and whip together a £40k deposit. Sometimes people want the flexibility of a rented place so they're not tied down somewhere long term. Sometimes we want holiday lets to encourage tourists and boost the local economy.\n\nI'm all for stopping the mega-landlords but dipping on people with a second home to try and bolster and diversify their retirement income isn't something we should be discouraging. The reality is a very large number of people who are young and may hate this today, will one day be old and their income will be higher and they'll realise that you're gonna need a diversified retirement income eventually, no matter how lame and evil it seems when you're younger.\n\nI'm not saying this as a landlord. I'm saying this as a reality check that bitching on something that you don't like today could just result in legislation that hurts your own future tomorrow. Be careful what you wish for.\n\nI think we need:\n\n1) Rent control\n\n2) Restrictions on mega-landlords (ie any more than one second home)\n\n3) More new homes built (that can't be rented out and must be bought by UK residents)\n\nI think we should also try to encourage people to look at ways to secure their pensions through whatever investment opportunities they can and not bitch on that. Owning a home to rent out later in life to support your (let's face it, pathetic state and private pension most of us will have) retirement income is something that helps the masses rather than helping giant profit devouring corporations. It's something for the people, so why are we so hell bent on trying to screw our future selves over?",

              "body": "The solution is to accept that financial devolution is fundamentally and unavoidably regressive and unfair. Taxation capacity and demand for social services are inversely correlated. So the only fair way to approach this is to centralise taxation, devolve spending and service delivery.\n\n\nCurrently, national rules dictate who is eligible for core council services like social care, social housing, children's services and SEND support. If you meet these criteria, your council must provide those services. It has no choice. Councils have almost no control over their income either; they get what they got last year again, with a limit on how much they can increase council tax by and no real influence over business rates or their share of a central government pot. Which means some councils are doing just fine and don't have to max out council tax each year, while others have no option but to illegally ration services and surrender to the few persistent enough to challenge in court/tribunal/ombudsman. \n\n\nI think we need to move to an NHS style commissioning model, but lighter touch. Equalise council tax and business rates across the country and pool those funds (which is then much easier to reform later on). Then work out what demand exists for various services. Older council areas need more social care. Poor younger areas need more spending on children's services. And have central government \"buy\" services off councils to meet the demand that central government have dictated.\n\n\nI'm talking exclusively about England here. But there are similar problems with the devolved administrations, who call for greater financial autonomy as a matter of principle while being heavily reliant on English tax receipts and while being unwilling to make the same damaging cuts and sacrifices England has been forced to endure. Different solutions are needed there.",

It cannot be right that the luck of where your LA boundary falls imposes a large extra tax burden or tax cut on you.\n\nEither LAs need to be allowed to spend only as much as they can afford to raise at whatever level of council tax is appropriate to their residents incomes, or you have to make the costs centralised.",

This also includes congestion charge and ULEZ funds that are collected by TfL.\n\nIn terms of active investment for future projects, this comes down to London paying out a substantial share on its own. This is part of why there's an aggressive push for more fiscal devolution and ability to create enterprise zones to finance the Bakerloo line extension, since Westminster has shown no interest in any funding for it and the trains on the Bakerloo line are the oldest in service in the UK at 52 years old.",

As such, the surplus that they are showing does not necessarily mean that the council tax system is fairly weighted across the country. \n\nIn fact, as the article points out, the people in the Northeast are paying more council tax on average. It seems to be that they should be expecting similar services from their local councils, and as such ought to pay similarly towards the cost of those services. \n\nI find the whole discussion of region specific taxes, services, and contributions to the economy to be broadly disingenuous and misleading to be honest.

They fail to capture the full nuance. \n\nTo fully capture the subsidy non-london regions are capturing, you would want to look at the entire tax burden of the regions, and individuals in those regions. \n\nBut on the other hand, this article is really pointing out the absurdity of the way local government funding works. Because of the way government grants haven't kept up with costs, local councils are having to use council tax to pay for more and more. \n\nSome regions have higher costs in these areas, such as health and social care, because they are more elderly. Or, because it costs more to administer the care in a rural region than an urban one. \n\nI don't think anyone here could in good faith argue that people living in, e.g., rural Cornwall ought to pay more in 'hospital tax' because it costs more to run per capita in that area of the country. We as a country should be supporting all our citizens and providing them with the same level of service. The tax burden of doing that should be shared equally. That is to say, in line with the wealth/income of the individuals. \n\nSince London has a higher concentration of wealth, it should probably have a surplus of tax income that is distributed to other, less wealthy regions.",

That's one reason why pints cost more in London. \n\n\nSupermarkets do not have the same prices. They vary with location. \n\n\nHigher nursery costs, linked to higher land prices.

It’s also a built-in NIMBY deterrent to some extent, since you’re being taxed on the unimproved value of the land there’s direct incentives to build something productive versus keeping something unproductive around. Combine this with taking social care out of the hands of councils in favour of a national care service and we might be able to make a dent in the urban rot that’s growing throughout the UK.",

As an example, Westminster (Central London)is £973 for band D, Redbridge (outer London) is £2089 for a band D.\n\nI agree about updating bands, I also think they should be proportions of housing stock in an area, so each area has the same % of bands a, b,c as otherwise you end up with half the properties in some councils being band a so there is no difference between a 1 bed flat and 3 bed semi. Generally newer houses are higher banded as councils try to get money where they can.",

I must admit that I am rather jealous of TFL services though, I used to visit London a lot to see family until recently, and what a world apart it is! \n*I also meant to type 2 up 2 down, not 2 up 1 down in my original comment, oops\n\nAlthough if you live in London and are lucky enough to already have your house paid off (like my Grandmother did before moving up to live with my parents) it can be quite a nice plus. \n\nI really like your idea in regards to proportions of housing stock, because the vast majority of properties in my area are indeed band a, despite there being such a variety in square footage/amenities. House values were just criminally low here in the early 90s, so many of the nicer properties were still under the threshold for band b etc, since there is no differentiation between a house that was worth 12k and a house that was worth 39k in 1991.\n\nA house that I live in (2 bed 1 bath, no garden) was bought for 8k in 1991, it's now worth 70k.  The house my best friend lives in (3 bed 2 bath, large garden) was bought for 22k in 2001 (couldn't find any earlier valuations unfortunately) and is now worth >100k, yet both are in the same tax band. It makes 0 sense. Obviously I don't want my best friend to be paying more CT, but it feels very unfair that we pay the same when you understand how different our houses are in size/amenities offered. Preferably I'd like to get a discount and for her CT to stay the same, but I know that's just wishful thinking. If a restructure happened I know that we'd most likely all end up paying more 😮‍💨",

                          "body": "> If you want to tax individuals, a local income tax would be fairer.\n\nWhy, do poorer people consume fewer services?\n\nA progressive tax system is not fairer, it just has the perception of fairness. It is about spreading the relative harm more equally, rather than asking people to pay for what they use. The issue is that the harm is now so significant that even comfortably middle class people are seeing their financial trajectory fall far short of what they were brought up to expect. When that happens, they - quite rightly - ask why they are being squeezed so much.\n\nCouncil services generally support working-class people. Working-class people in the UK have a better life trajectory today than they did historically. Middle-class people have a worse life trajectory today than they did historically. To continue to squeeze the middle-class in order to advantage the working-class members of society is definitely not fair.\n\nIf the middle class could shoulder the burden without seeing their life trajectory change, then that's something most people can agree is fair. But as they can't, then the current progressive approach is morally indefensible.\n\nTo clarify what I mean by life trajectory - I mean in terms of life stages by age group. A middle-class person expects to go to university, buy a house in their late 20s/early 30s, have children at roughly the same time, and then enjoy \"cultural\" foreign holidays and semi-luxury products until a comfortable retirement.\n\nA working-class person expects to rent until their 40s, have children reasonably early, drive a modest car and buy modest products, and go to Benidorm, before spending their retirement down the pub. We base these expectations on what our parents did.\n\nToday, a working-class family can buy a house as easily as a middle-class one, because of the concentration of middle-class jobs in high cost of living areas and the fact that minimum wage has grown substantially faster than middle-class salaries. Working class people tend to have children earlier, because the difference between government support and work is smaller, especially when you take into account lost potential earnings due to promotion, which is rarer among working class people. \n\nMiddle-class people, by contrast, are often completely unable to buy a house in their locality, can't risk taking time off for children due to the disruption to their career, and certainly can't afford semi-luxury brands or 'cultural' foreign holidays.\n\nSo when working-class people are having better outcomes than their parents, and middle-class people are having worse ones, then is it really fair to expect the middle-class to pay even more towards the services that disproportionately benefit the working-class?",

They said this just recently with the new Renters Rights bill, and they also said it when stamp duty was increased on second homes. If it hurts landlords pockets the response is always \"well that'll lead to an increase in rental costs then\".\n\nBuy to let landlordism needs to go. Yes we need rentals, but not necessarily private rentals. A strong social housing sector and an increase in housing associations would be much more productive. \n\nThe only reason that private renting is so expensive is because private landlords prey on the fact that people need somewhere to live, so they buy up available properties and greatly inflate the price of renting. A privately rented house in my city (same size/location as my house) is around £1100/month. My rent in a housing association is £800/month.* When you pay for rent privately you're paying for rental costs, but you're also paying your landlord's lifestyle on top of that. We need to cut the middle man out. \n\nShelter is a human right, just like healthcare is. It shouldn't be abused for profit like it currently is being.\n\n*I also live in an area where houses are relatively cheap, but rent is very high. There is such a shortage of properties here to buy/rent that landlords feel they can charge through the nose for renting. It's actually significantly cheaper to buy a house and pay a mortgage than it is to rent where I live.",

Any property tax should be administered nationally and redistributed nationally too (ideally a 50/50 split). The whole system is fundamentally broken. The UK reminds me of horrible software projects where broken business rules create absurd logical outcomes, and then we try to add more rules to deal with them absurd outcomes instead of dealing with the root causes in the first place.

              "body": "There are two purposes to tax - firstly to fund spending and secondly to alter behaviour. For funding spending you can argue that progressive taxes are fairer and better because they maximise spending power on a public and individual level, but property taxes are primarily designed to promote certain behaviours. \n\nProperty is currently seen as a safe haven investment because unlike most other investments, it has no or low tax associated with ownership. This has led to hoarding and socially damaging behaviour: large homes are not occupied by families but by couples over 50, prices have soared in a permanent bubble and increasingly property is bought up by wealthy people to rent out or to sit empty. Homeowners have incentive to influence planning policy to maintain or increase property value.\n\nTo fix this, we need a tax based on the property value that will reduce the incentive to hoard and invest in existing property. Putting those funds into housebuilding, with the newly YIMBY population less keen to inflate their house prices, will finally increase supply to reasonable levels.",

Appreciate it's about the rise in employer national insurance contributions which needs to be absorbed by councils as public sector employer \n\nIt should be noted that councils would be a lot more exposed if they actually had more staff. But have already been letting lots of people go due to austerity.  Agencies will pass on some of the costs but it means there was a major shortfall already before.\n\nWhich in turn makes you wonder if all the telegraph is doing is shifting the blame onto Reeves knowing full well there has been a 40 percent cut in funding in local authorities since 2010 and a cap on council tax rises which only recently has been lifted for many councils. I wonder which party was in charge during those years... Ah yes... \n\nIn tomorrows news, labour going to be blamed for rising crime despite the Tories shutting all the police stations and labour to be blamed for you forgetting valentine's day.

Mother is in the same state, she nearly died about a year ago when she was ninety two, even made the hospital dash as she only had a couple of hours at most.

The vibe of OP’s post is essentially, “Rich people contribute way more than you peasants so you should respect them and feel ashamed for taking rather than giving to society.”\n\nBut you can totally flip his statement to:\n\n“How do you feel that 53% of people are paid so little for the critical services they provide to the country?”\n\nSociety absolutely must have all these low paid jobs in order to tick. And those rich people contributing more taxes absolutely rely on those poor people in order to for them to enjoy their lifestyle and enjoy the kind of life they’ve achieved.\n\nIt would be like a guy on top of a human pyramid bitching about all the people below him and saying, “You guys could all be as high up as me if you tried harder.” Well no, you can’t have everyone at the top of a human period in the same way you can’t have everyone at the top of society and those at the top can only be where they are thanks to the load carried by everyone beneath them.\n\nIt makes me think about any kind of argument where someone states along the lines of, “It’s your own fault you didn’t become a millionaire. You’re just lazy.”\n\nTo which we have to ask, ok, so what if everyone in the country bust their balls to become millionaires. Maybe they all decided to do a law degree to become a top judge or perhaps a top doctor. Well guess what happens, you end up with millions of highly qualified people that can’t find high paying jobs because everyone else did the same thing and what do we end up with? Exactly the same number of people working as cleaners, manual labourers or any other form of employment rich people or their supporters look down on. You just end up with a load of overqualified poor people who society look down on, even though they bust their balls trying to succeed. \n\nSo yes, I’m totally fine with the top 10% paying the most because they’re only there because they’re balancing on the backs of everyone else’s hard underpaid work. And I say this as someone in the top 10%. And incidentally, technically the top 10% can range from around 80k all the way to bringing in millions a year, so there’s a pretty huge range there from someone that still doesn’t have a massive take home after pensions and tax contributions, all the way up to someone owning private jets.",

You responded to:\n\n>\"The price of everything and the value of nothing\" springs to mind.\n\n>Would the country be better off without the nurse, with her measly cash tax contribution?\n\n>Technically, yes, because we now hire an extra nurse.\n\nYou said we'd be better off without a nurse. But in your explanation above, you're describing who contributes more. They're different things. \n\nPerhaps you interpreted that as \"we'd be better off without the nurse than the head of marketing\". That's not what it says but I'm trying my best to understand you. \n\nMy biggest problem with this is it assumes one can simply magic up a new person who would be a good nurse to spend the tax money on. I don't think that's really how the world works, but if you accept it as part of the model then you've got to accept you can magic up heads of marketing, so if you get rid of them a new one will appear. So the question becomes moot if for every person we get rid of a new one replaces the demand. If instead we think that you can't simply magic people up then we have to ask what we'd prefer one fewer of.\n\nBut also it assumes that the contribution the head of marketing of a light bulb company makes is entirely additive. Most of their work is spent convincing the consumer to buy their light bulbs over another firm's. Her employer pays her that because it's worth it _to them_, rather than to broader society. The bulk of her job isn't to create value, but to divert it. One can talk about advertising creating value through \"providing information\" but no-one is being paid that much to provide info. If anything it's more about misinformation. And the cost of it ends up in the product. So if that head of marketing ceases to be, what happens? Does the product get cheaper, meaning more spend elsewhere with other tax pick up? Does the product price stay the same, but the company makes more money, thus more tax pickup?  Does another company get the sales instead, and they're taxed more? There's an argument that she _creates_ demand, which (arguably) boosts the economy, but at best you can only argue that's a part of her role. So if you magic her away there is a significantly less than £44k impact to the Exchequer.",

Not really a problem.\n\n>If instead we think that you can't simply magic people up then we have to ask what we'd prefer one fewer of\n\nThe nurse then. Provides less value to society. Less taxes, less money spent to local businesses etc. \n\n>Her employer pays her that because it's worth it *to them*, rather than to broader society\n\nHer employer is part of society, no? What's the problem there? \n\n>The bulk of her job isn't to create value, but to divert it.\n\nBy that logic so is the nurse. Nothing of value is created by the nurse, she just moves pills, people and paperwork around, no? \n\nI don't believe that, but if we're reducing somebody's job to absurdities, let's reduce both jobs, in the spirit of fairness, no? \n\n>One can talk about advertising creating value through \"providing information\" but no-one is being paid that much to provide info.\n\nLmao, nobody told you about Google engineers then. \n\n>There's an argument that she *creates* demand, which (arguably) boosts the economy, but at best you can only argue that's a part of her role. So if you magic her away there is a significantly less than £44k impact to the Exchequer.\n\nBahahaha, did you just call companies stupid for having a head of marketing? Or for doing marketing in general? \n\nBy definition, her job has to provide more value than it costs or it wouldn't exist. \n\nThere are no six figure jobs that don't provide six figure worth of value to the companies, or those companies will go bust in no time. \n\nI'm fairly sure your logic problem is **assuming** the nurse does more to society than the head of marketing. That's called begging the question. \n\nI don't believe that's the case for the simple fact that one is paid vastly more than the other.  Meaning it's more productive to society.\n\nYou're most likely referring to some inherent, unmeasurable, kind of subjective value. It \"feels\" more valuable. But you can't say why. \n\nThat's just your opinion and you are free to hire a nurse for six figures and laugh at marketing. Society will continue to ignore you and your opinions on value.",

Of course your share of tax should be significantly more than your share of income if you're a higher earner (although if we could bring wealth into the equation that would be better).\n\nBut you're also arguing against yourself. You want a tax system that taxes people at the same proportional rate, and lowering the additional rate band meant that people earning £130k paid at the same rate as someone at £200k. Surely that is what you want? \n\n>loss of personal tax allowances, loss of free childcare hours and tax free childcare\n\nI absolutely agree that this is absurd, as well as the child benefit earnings limit at £60k.",

If a pretty shit life costs 10 Currency Units a year, then if some bloke earns 10 he can't also afford tax. To tax him would result in poverty. If a reasonable life with everything one needs and some things one wants costs 20 and someone earns 30, then taxing them 40% is going to be pretty rubbish. So you tax him, for example, 20%. If you've then got a third guy who earns 80 then if you tax him 40% he'll have 48 and have a lovely time. Obviously you graduate it as we do now but I've tried to keep it simple, what with it being bleeding obvious from what I said before. \n\nObviously all the numbers and rates are illustrative.",

There have not been societies without work.\n\n> Also you would learn that a lot of \"owners\" actually do also the work and not just sit in an office managing people.\n\nWell, maybe executives could be a bit more open about what they actually do with their time. Many of them seem quite cagey about it, partly because they don't want to be liable for anything illegal and partly because a lot of what they do is quite embarrassing.\n\nPerfect examples of both are provided by that eBay CEO who spent a huge amount of the company's money building a replica of his favourite bar next to his office, just for him and his friends to drink in. When some bloggers reported on this, he launched a vendetta against them and had his staff send them an impressive variety of threatening and disturbing messages and packages. Of course, he didn't put any of this in writing and successfully pretended that they had just decided to do all this of their own accord. So they and the company got into trouble and he waltzed into another high-paying executive role at another company. And it's that last part that's the really damning bit. If the system works as you seem to believe, with the hard-working people rising to the top and heroically organizing everything, then why on earth would any company want to hire this guy in a senior role after everything he did?",

It'd be interesting if there were any global comparisons.\n\nThe 60% figure often cited is explained nicely by the IFS below, where they provide historical context (this percentage is very high).\n\nThe second link provides geographical context and wider tax base context.\n\n*The amount the UK raises through income taxes (a category that includes smaller taxes such as capital gains tax, as well as the main income tax) is broadly in line with international norms – it is Scandinavia that stands out, with higher income taxes than elsewhere.*\n\n*The amount the UK raises through VAT is also comparable to most other developed economies (other than the US, which is now almost alone in not operating a VAT). *\n\nIt also talks about how our median tax rate is unusually low by contrast, which is the primary reason for the gap between us and European countries.\n\nhttps://ifs.org.uk/taxlab/taxlab-taxes-explained/income-tax-explained\n\nhttps://ifs.org.uk/taxlab/taxlab-key-questions/how-do-uk-tax-revenues-compare-internationally",

Of course they're going to end up paying the lions share in income tax.\n\nWhen you consider all taxes, the lowest quintile pay the highest proportion of tax. \n\n> They spent 38.4 per cent of their gross income on taxes, the next quintile spent 30.5 per cent, the middle quintile 30.4 per cent, the second from top quintile 31.5 per cent and the highest earners 36.9 per cent.\n\n(also note that that set of data is much more closely aligned than the 10% pay 60% point towards, proportionally we're all paying 30-40% it just happens that 36% of a lot, is more than 38% of bugger all.)\n\n>This is mostly because indirect taxes, especially VAT, are highly regressive. For example, in 2021/22, the bottom quintile paid 12.4 per cent of their gross income on VAT, over two and a half times as much as the top quintile, who paid 4.7 per cent of their gross income on VAT.\n\nhttps://www.civitas.org.uk/2023/07/18/effects-of-taxes-and-benefits-on-uk-household-income/#:%7E:text=In%202021%2F22%2C%20the%20top,per%20cent%2C%2016.7%20per%20cent",

And that is when you account for income tax, social contributions, VAT and sales taxes, property tax and other things like fuel duty.\n\nThe notion that the UK is a high tax jurisdiction is ludicrous, for about 60-70% of the population it's effectively a tax free heaven compared to the rest of the developed work, for the next 20-30% it's more or less inline with their counterparts in Europe for the top 10% and top 1% they are taxed considerably more.\n\nAnd what's worse is that the ever shrinking tax base of net contributors are means tested out of the systems they fund, whilst over on the continent not only they aren't means tested of things like unemployment insurance but the payout on those tends to be in line with your past pay and past contributions so those who pay in more get out more when they need it.\n\nOnly in the UK it's perfectly acceptable for people not to get unemployment benefits because they dared to be financially responsible and thus have savings and are also so inconsiderate of others by having a partner that also happens to work.",

              "body": "> When you account for all other taxes that households pay the taxes as a percentage of their disposable income paid by households are fairly flat across households from low to high income (between 25-35%).\n\nThat doesn't mean it's flat to the government though. 25% of £100 is a bit different than 25% of £1000, no? That's the point of the submission, that £250 is much larger than £25.\n\n>By the way benefits in the ONS context includes benefits-in-kind like spending on education and healthcare.\n\nSo? It's kinda assumed that's the case? It would be kinda weird if more than half the country got paid in cash more than they paid in taxes.",

The majority are also paying for the life of the richest, through the surplus value extracted from their labour.\n\n\nSecondly, the richest are the ones who benefit the most from society, and it's right that they should pay the most for its upkeep. It would be impossible to run most businesses if the government didn't provide roads, or police, or a literate workforce.",

          "body": "The ONS link answers the question. In 2022, 53.8% of people were net recipients. Among retirees, it was 89.2%, mainly due to the State Pension being classed as a benefit.\n\nThe Commons Library stat aligns with this. The top 10% of income taxpayers paid over 60% of income tax, confirming a strong redistributive effect.\n\nUnlike many European systems, especially in the Nordics, the UK model is rights-based rather than contribution-based. Nordic countries offer broad, generous benefits, but access/amounts are often linked to prior contributions through social insurance. The UK offers more targeted support regardless of contribution history, which creates a wider pool of recipients and relies more heavily on a smaller group of high earners to fund the system. Combined with a high cost of living, this makes the tax burden more concentrated.\n\nCompared to Nordic and many EU countries, the UK system offers less in return for higher contributors. In much of Europe, benefits are often earnings-linked, meaning those who pay more in receive more out, especially during unemployment or retirement. In the UK, support is largely flat and means-tested, so prior contributions have little bearing on the level of help received. This results in higher earners shouldering a greater share of the tax burden while receiving less support than they would in comparable European systems. The policy focus has been on raising the lowest-income households, effectively flattening the working and underclass, with limited emphasis on maintaining living standards for the middle.",

In reality, the UK concentrates support on the lowest income groups through a rights-based, means-tested system, while countries like Sweden, Denmark and Norway use contribution-based models where benefits are linked to prior earnings.\n\nThis means middle and higher earners in Nordic systems receive proportionate support when unemployed or ill, reinforcing a broad social contract. In the UK, many contributors find themselves excluded when they need help, despite years of tax payments. The result is a weaker social contract. Why support a system that offers little in return during difficult times?\n\nEasy to see why many people believe in reducing benefits take little issue with it.",

But income inequality in the UK has grown more than in most OECD countries.  Today the level of UK income inequality is high international standards, as seen in Figure 2, which shows the Gini coefficient – a summary measure of income inequality across the distribution – for OECD countries. Looking beneath that simple summary measure, it turns out that it is largely the degree of inequality between high- and middle- income people that sets the UK apart from many of its comparators.\n\nOur tax base is skewed because we have a class of extraordinarily wealthy people. We allow them to attain phenomenal wealth and income and then people like you indulge their self-perceived victimhood. Insane.",

But income inequality in the UK has grown more than in most OECD countries.  Today the level of UK income inequality is high international standards, as seen in Figure 2, which shows the Gini coefficient – a summary measure of income inequality across the distribution – for OECD countries. Looking beneath that simple summary measure, it turns out that it is largely the degree of inequality between high- and middle- income people that sets the UK apart from many of its comparators.",

Yes minimum wages for adults have roughly doubled in GBP terms since they were introduced, but [this graph](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1002964/average-full-time-annual-earnings-in-the-uk/) suggests overall median earnings have also roughly doubled in the same period? And minimum wage is inherently linked to both cost of living and inflation.\n\nIf the minimum wage was lower, wouldn't we just see more people requiring in-work benefits to make up the difference between cost of living and their minimum wage?\n\nNot disputing your argument, just looking for a clearer understanding - do you mean that the upper quintiles aren't rich enough? Or do you think that minimum wage and in-work benefits mean there's no real \"stick\" to motivate people out of poverty any more?",

That is why they hire them in the first place.\n\nCompanies don't last long if they are paying more in salaries then they have in revenue. By the very fact of a company being profitable shows that the employees they have hired are being more productive and producing more in terms of output than the founder or owner has put into them.\n\nEvery single company wants to poach and needs highly skilled employees. That's why they poach from other companies or companies like Meta can pay very high salaries.\n\nBecause they understand they need productive and highly skilled employees for the company to operate and make money.\n\nIf META just paid their employees nothing but just gave it all to Zukerberg then it would fail. Why? Because Zuckerberg isn't actually essential to the functioning of META or the business, the people who are employed there actually making the products are, and if they started leaving then the business would start to struggle.",

That Ltd Company is struggling as there has been a huge increase in taxes & NI costs etc from Labour so I need to unfortunately increase rents to cover that otherwise the company would be making a loss. It makes basically no profit as it is but Labour are squeezing businesses hard so tough decisions need to be made.\n\nAlso in regards to me not living there. Tbf I applied for a UK visa for my wife & mother of my child and it was rejected because the UK visa system is a ridiculous checkbox exercise and we forgot to include an English test.\n\nI assume they didn't want our tax income so we're looking at Dubai now instead.",

Assuming the majority enter the workplace at 18 that means a full 1/3 are out of the equation before we even begin.\n\nBaby boomers are today between the ages of around 60 to 79. I don't have the raw numbers but it's a fair estimate that there are significantly more people in this demographic than there are Gen Z before we even take into account that a full 1/3 of the latter are still at school. Granted, not all will be retired, but the vast majority will be.\n\nNice of the Telegraph to give their permanently aggrieved readership a bit of ammo to go into the weekend with so they can revel in beating their poor fucking kids and grandkids over the head with it.",

And of course, that would mean that people were more likely to not bother earning, and set their life up so that they could just live off the free money instead.  And the more people that did that, the more you'd have to increase taxes on those still working to compensate.\n\nFrom a moral perspective:\n\nYou'd end up reducing the money given to disabled people that need support, and instead giving it to people that wouldn't bother working.  Which is immoral.\n\nFrom a practical perspective:\n\nAn entire generation of people would leave school and suddenly be in receipt of more money than they had ever had.

They're better researched in the way that studies exist, but they're really low quality. Most of the trials that have been done either weren't universal, weren't a high enough sum to be considered income or they communicated the end date with the participants so they just banked the free money and lived their lives as normal, using the saving for things like house deposits. We have no idea whatsoever how a UBI affects people's behaviour or the wider economy.",

Replacing many of those with this one could be more or less cost-neutral, especially since this is easier to administrate than lots of our existing systems.\n\nLow earners also receive a large proportion of benefits at the moment, they don't all go to people out of work. So again, replacing with your suggestion could be almost cost neutral.\n\nThe big financial cost is whether some people would stop working - or work less - because if this suggestion. That could be expensive for the government and also damaging to the economy. But from data I've seen on UBI trials elsewhere, most people are not any less likely to work. The major exception is mothers of young children, who are far less likely to work if they have the option not to... but personally, I think there are strong societal advantages to children having parents home when they are young.\n\nMorally... lots of people wouldn't like it, and I'm not sure how popular it would be.",

                      "body": "It's 7-8% of total government spending. It's about half of what we spend on pensioner benefits and what we spend on health, about the same as what we spend on education, and a bit less than ~~half of~~ double what we spend on defence. It's over half of the total wealth - not income - of all of the UK's billionaires, and it's five times the total civil service wage bill.\n\nYes, it's a lot of money. It's a vast amount of money. That doesn't mean it's wasted money.\n\nI don't think \"how much should we be spending?\" is quite the right question, however. As with pensioner benefits, the number of people (as a % of the population) supported by this spending has increased and is expected to increase. That leaves us with two broad options:\n\n* We think that the current spending per person is about right. So to maintain that per person spend, we have to increase total spending. Which means tax rises, or it means cuts to other public services to fund it.\n* Or we think the total spending is about right. Which means we have to reduce the per person spending to spread that budget thinner across more people.\n\nNeither of these options are good or sustainable. Long term, either route would either bankrupt the government or lead to immense suffering for the vulnerable. Or, more likely, both.\n\nThere is a third option; reduce the number of people on disability benefits, by making people healthier and more able to support themselves through sensible, meaningful, safe and sustainable work. Successive governments have tried, and failed, to do this.",

You can only do this if you take a holistic approach to the problem and a long term (i.e. more than one parliament) view.\n\n\nWe need investment in prevention as that is far cheaper in the long term, but you can only do that if you have a bit of breathing space.",

If someone won't even let you work for free how are you going to find someone who'll pay you to work for them?",

Eventually I decided to go to university and then over time the social anxiety wasn't that much of an issue since a large part of overcoming anxiety is to actually get out there and put yourself in uncomfortable positions and adapt.\n\nIf you're getting paid a decent amount to stay at home and avoid social situations or whatever brings on your anxiety, then it sort of encourages that lifestyle for some people. In some cases it's only a disability because they believe it to be, not because it actually is.\n\nUnfortunately when you're used to not working and having all the free time in the world, even the thought of changing that can trigger anxiety all on its own, so it can become self-perpetuating. No doubt there are also people who intentionally seek out that sort of lifestyle.",

For many simply just going and doing something can be more harmful because they have a negative experience and it reinforces their fear.\n\nThis would be easily solved with more investment in the mental health care system - you probably aren't going to cure someone with severe anxiety in the standard NHS six sessions - and that would help people back into the world and off disability benefits, but it seems like that just isn't going to happen.",

Or at least, the treatment itself might not have been better, but at least it was easier to get an appointment when you reached out for help. \n\nAlso working and social conditions were less stressful in many ways. There were both blue- and white-collar jobs that didn't expect a university degree as a basic starting point, a family could live on a single wage, most reputable firms valued worker retention and were willing to invest (within reason) in someone they hoped would stay for a long-term career, in most jobs you weren't expected to be contactable outside work hours, and the social media/hustle culture of having to be constantly \"on\" all the time hadn't started yet.

You've jumped on the polar end of the argument for ease and it's just not a productive way to discuss this.\n\nNowhere have I suggested this should be the case for everyone. Your friend certainly sounds like they have very real health challenges to being able to work. That is not my point at all.\n\nMy point is for making this option available for those people who are physically able to be able to work, but are claiming challenges to their mental health as the reason to not.\n\nAs another commenter has highlighted there is abundant research that points to working and having a purpose in a day to day life carries immense benefits to an individuals mental health, so why aren't we actively looking at supporting people in this way?",

They didn't say 'the Work Capability Assessment needs to become stricter' or imply anything of the sort. Can you explain to me where in the comment that I was responding to that my friend would be an exception to their policy suggestion? Because every single time that the government has cracked down on disability benefits, it makes it life harder for people who receive them legitimately - I have no reason to believe that this time will be any different",

I guess you could say if your so depressed you can't do basic things you need the financial support? \n\n  \nI know someone who gets PIP for anxiety who goes to theme parks and concerts multiple times a month, all the while getting a discount because her husband is her 'carer'.

You're just assuming number of appointments and more spending means no cuts whatsoever.\n\nThe number of appointments and how much money goes into the service doesn't mean that certain services haven't been cut. Like the \"we've increased budgets\" political lines, the \"we had this many appointments\" excuse is used for fiddling the figures. Think about it. If one department increased their appointments by 1000, but another had their own cut by 1000, you'd assume, based on the brag of appointment numbers, that everything is the same. When in actual fact, a service has been cut.\n\nMental health services have been cut for example, which might explain some of the explosion in PIP claims. I know mental health services have been cut from experience.\n\nIf your partner is a doctor, I'm quite surprised that this hasn't been explained to you. I've spent a lot of time with medical professionals recently, and they all say the same as what I am saying right now.\n\nI've been in A&E numerous times this past year due to my Dad being admitted for various problems. My Uncle was in and out before he passed away. There aren't migrants lining the halls of A&E on trolleys or chairs. The majority are old people.\n\nSocial care, or lack of in this country, is one of the most damaging and costly expenses to the NHS right now. As I said, 5 mins in A&E would show you that. Another is that the NHS operates in a reactive manner to healthcare, instead of a preventative one. It's cheaper to prevent serious health issues than it is to wait until they become major ones. It is only just beginning to move from cure to prevention now.",

How far do you think £50 goes?\n\nAccording to the media people on £50k a year are struggling because ~£3,000 a month net doesn't go all that far these days, but at the same time £200 a month is an absolute fortune that is sufficient to replace employment income entirely - they really need to pick a lane because both those things can't be true.",

In my experience the difference between someone that manages to overcome that and someone that becomes an anxiety ridden recluse is often whether they are offered an easy \"out\" to excuse themselves from everyday tasks. Some families and friend groups are so scared of pushing people out of their comfort zone that they simply act as enablers to allow someone to stay within a safe bubble, which simply exacerbates those symptoms due to lack of exposure. We're seeing that also happen with employers and government benefits too, and I question whether it is actually more harmful in the long run to enable these behaviours rather than force people to face their anxieties head on.\n\nWe are also starting to see a significant amount of people weaponising clinical language to get what they want, and the benefit scammers of old with their medically unprovable bad back (not to say that people with genuine back pains don't exist btw) are now moving onto claiming benefits for mental health instead since it's so easy to fake.",

Our welfare spending is around **10% of GDP**, and the trajectory is that it will just indefinitely increase.\n\nIn other words it is *completely unsustainable*, and it dwarfs what the government spends on productive investment, e.g. gov spends around £15 billion on research and development - just imagine if you flip it around, £90 billion on R&D every year and £15 billion on disabilities, £90 billion on basic science research would genuinely make us a science superpower\n\nBut it's not just R&D. The opportunity cost of all this welfare spending is paying people to do actual jobs which improves society.\n\nFor example £2 billion a year could get us over 70,000 full-time litter pickers at £28k a year, £1.5 billion could pay for 43 full-time orchestras with generous £35 million annual budget (or you could fund theatre companies/art galleries, film studios - whatever!), £15 billion could make off peak rail transport completely free to use and peak trains about 90% cheaper.\n\nAnd then just consider things like museums and public spaces and all the jobs they create in construction but then in cafes and shops etc - and all for a *fraction* of what we spend on welfare\n\n* *Titanic Belfast* is a major tourist attraction and a big part of the city, and yet it cost just \\~£140m\n* *Deep Blue* in Hull, a large and modern aquarium which also does important conservation research, that was around £90m to construct adjusting for inflation.",

          "body": "As someone on PIP though predominantly for being on the spectrum as opposed to my anxiety. I strongly believe a lot of it should be used for therapy in the case of anxiety. I hope to become immune to the anxiety and depression I have and be able to handle it, though I don’t count on it given a lot of it stems from being on the spectrum. That being said therapy does me so much good, I’m far better when I’m in therapy and it’s helped me with my work/social life and PIP enables the therapy that keeps me on the straight and narrow. \n\nWhen I haven’t been in therapy I’ve been far more isolated, I think a lot of this need for therapy for people with anxiety stems from societal issues that are not easy and may not be possible to solve, e.g decline in living standards, prejudice etc. \n\nI think there is something to PIP being more targeted in the case of anxiety but on the flip side for other conditions such as people on the spectrum, we are never going to not be on the spectrum and we’re a lot more productive to society if we’re able to work doing something we’re ok with and not being reassessed for a life long condition constantly. Far better than the alternative where we struggle to hold down a job, often in low paid work or end up unemployed. Having a monetary buffer for situations like unemployment is vital for those on the spectrum. I was nearly made redundant and if I was and had to immediately jump into any old job regardless of if being something I could manage, would very likely  have caused me to regress/become unemployed for at least 6 months/a year or more and i would have struggled to get out of that rut.",

We don't debate every pension rise individually.\n\nI'd add one more, namely the university tuition fees.

Either that or start dying earlier, but I can't see that being overly popular as a policy. \n\nI'd actually like to see a graph plotting average cost to the state by age, because I'd bet my left nipple it explodes after 70 when the grim shit really starts to kick in. Obviously it absolutely sucks that most of us are gonna get to that age and live through a boat load of nasty ailments, but that's likely what's gonna happen and we're gonna cost the state a fortune too. Not a clue what the answer is to be honest, but that's the situation we're in and it's pants.",

A single was anywhere from £2.50-£6 to the end of the line. \n\nThe £2 was a lifesaver for many. Considering the Tories wanted to scrap it and many bus companies stating for many routes it’s not sustainable I think the £3 is still a bargain.\n\nHowever our local area has brought in for the next 6 months travel for teens/students/kids for £1. Which I also think is great. \n\nThe wider issue hasn’t been addressed still Public transport costs and its reliability, because outside of London and a few cities it’s god awful most places especially if a little rural. It makes way more sense if you can afford to get a car and pass to drive. That’s the issue that needs solving longer term.",

We need trains because no other form of transport can deliver anywhere near the traffic density they can, but it's a fallacy to expect them to be cheap.

The price that was displayed was without the cut, and upon paying they applied the cut like a discount, including the figure in the receipt.

For me a 15 minute bus back from the pub now costs the same amount as a 2 hour journey to Lincoln. That's lovely but it's not a sensible or sustainable model especially as it's run by for profit businesses who are raking it in.",

I think people have lost all sense of what old people are at this point.\n\n  \nThey are, mostly, normal people, nice people, very much like 'us', who were part of a system their whole life which promised them a state pension they could live on at retirement, and they worked hard and contributed to the economy for decades to get there.\n\n  \nPeople are seriously losing sight of the real problem. The UK does not have a particularly generous state pension amongst similar sized/advanced economies. I think part of this hatred is stemming from people believing the state pension won't be there when they arrive at state pension age, and being bitter about it (which I understand).\n\n  \nThe problem is successive governments over decades failing to invest in a fund which could help us create a more stable state pension, and locking in commitments that this will be available to future generations too, not old people.",

As this is explicitly an Employer’s rise, it gives employees wiggle room to have better salary negotiations or to leave and find a company that will pay the Er’s NIC.\n\nAdditionally, a rise in Ee’s NIC will directly show in your payslip; the only way existing employees are going to be cash worse off is if companies decide to cut pay, but they would not do that.",

Are you even going to move job over 1%??\n\nOr are you going to tell your job that your next 2% pay rise needs to be 3% or you will quit (because obviously it would have been 3% before the budget and you 100% expect the company to bear the cost)\n\nNot how the world works.

The way the market works is people are more likely to go for jobs with a bigger salary, and those jobs with the higher salaries are just going to absorb the tax, forcing other companies to hike their salaries accordingly.\n\nCompanies I have spoken/heard about to today fall in to three categories;\n\n1. Will factor it in to future pay rises.\n\n2. Will absorb it as a bottom line cost.\n\n3. Too big/profitable to care.\n\nIt will be interesting to see the long term reaction to this.",

People on median wages and below haven't paid this little in tax since the mid 70s, and yet our tax burden is the highest it has been since the 40s. Why? Because higher earners are already hugely overtaxed. In the long run, we are going to see a brain drain because of this - people with ambition will leave, and people who earn more and reach breaking point will leave as well. And then we will be well and truly fucked, and the tax base will be widened by force. Better the government does it on its own terms, but of course, that won't happen.",

Wages are absolute dogshit\n\nThis issue is also exacerbated by housing being far too expensive. In fact, this is probably the biggest cause of financial issues in the country. Lower housing costs and you can raise taxes. Lower them and people have more take-home. Lower them and maybe fewer people have to work and could look after their kids. Lower them and we won’t need as much childcare costs so taxes could even rise a bit further. Lower them and the workforce shrinks, leaving more wage per head as a take home, which in turn generates more tax. \n\nBasically, build some fucking houses",

Both Tory policies.\n\nThe man who left the note for the incoming government in 2010 was Liam Byrne, Chief Secretary to the Treasury. Here's what he had to say about it years later:\n\n>In government, it was my job to craft a plan. **As chief secretary, I spent bruising months negotiating £32bn of annual savings to help halve the deficit in just four years and set out in huge detail in our 2010 budget. Of course, the Conservatives attacked us – though it was the timetable they eventually delivered.**\n\n>Those negotiations were tough and bruising. And so in my final hours of office, I was writing thank-you notes to my incredible team of civil servants. And then I thought I’d write one letter more to my successor. **Into my head came the phrase I’d used to negotiate all those massive savings with my colleagues: “I’m afraid there is no money.”**\n\nand\n\n>People’s anger – and my party’s anger – at me, will never ever match my anger with myself or my remorse at such a crass mistake. I made it easy for our opponents to bash our economic record by bashing me. And for millions of people and businesses who have had to make such sacrifices over the last five years, there was nothing funny about the national debt when the national task of cutting it has brought them such pain in their everyday life.\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/09/liam-byrne-apology-letter-there-is-no-money-labour-general-election](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/09/liam-byrne-apology-letter-there-is-no-money-labour-general-election)\n\nAs Byrne makes clear, the Tories continued the austerity plan Labour had already put in place. And while Byrne apologised for the note and the political ammunition it gifted the coalition, he is clear that it was a phrase he had used with his colleagues to explain the planned cuts.",

The public don't understand this though; labour are happy to say that Tories caused massive inflation recently when in reality it was a global event and if labour got into power 3 years earlier and tabled their inflationary budget before Ukraine kicked off then the inflation peak would have been higher..

On that original point, you are wrong (which is obviously why you changed your position).\n\nThe narrative that Labour can't be trusted to manage the economy has prevailed for most of the past 14 years.  It was a dominant narrative, as well, with the Tories polling as much as 15-20 points ahead of Labour for most of their time in power.  It was only in the wake of Truss's actions that the polling switched and Labour took the lead on the economy.  Even then, Labour were and are still carrying a narrative burden due to the rhetoric related to 08; the polling numbers didn't switch dramatically, with Labour and the Tories both hovering around similar trust scores, and the Tories are now starting to eek out small leads again.  \n\nOn austerity, the Tories have fared far better than Labour have in terms of carrying that narrative burden.   There was some push back on how it was done, with a lot of people viewing it as unfair, but people seem to forget that there was majority support for austerity when it was first brought in, with most people viewing it as \"necessary\".  It wasn't until 2018-2019 that we started to see widespread backlash against ongoing austerity, but even then... this didn't translate into people thinking the Tories weren't trustworthy on the economy.  The idea that the failures or excessiveness of austerity speaks to the Tory's trustworthiness on the economy is largely (almost entirely, in fact) a left wing talking point that doesn't translate to the wider electorate's perspective.  Given the fact that the Tories didn't lose credibility on the economy until after Truss, and given that they are once again starting to see gains on Labour when it comes to trustworthiness on the economy, it's safe to say that austerity has had no meaningful impact on how people view the Tories on this point.",

Completely undesirable put in the context of annual price increases (which haven't been as low as 1-2% for some time) this looks overblown and just the media trying to beat their favourite target a Labour Government.

I don’t mind people posting the links from which the DM article is sourced but DM warps headlines and most people don’t read beyond it.",

This government increased spending by $76bn whilst raising taxes by an extremely questionable £30bn, much of which was raised by this NI raid. The reality of the system is that Truss got it wrong by not having economists analyse her position before announcing it, and Reeves got it wrong by having fraudulent economists analyse hers and pretending everything was fine. We likely won't find out about the latter for a few months, though.",

              "body": "It’s the thing that is tilting one of our local medical practices into collapse. General Practice has been absolutely hollowed out.\n\n- GMS funding in 1992 ~£100 per patient per year\n- GMS funding in 2025 ~£122 per patient per year\n- Effect of compound inflation between 1992 and 2025 = x 0.46 \n\n£122 per patient in 2025 enables GPs to pay for a little over *half* the staff, services, building leases, etc than they could in 1992, and that’s before the government mandated rises in employer NI and pension contributions where payroll can typically make up 40 to 80% of a practice’s overall expenditure.\n\nTo avoid redundancies and to continue delivering services at a high level to their community, the partners at this local practice have been filling the funding shortfall for COL rises and government mandated payrises, and employer pension increases by reducing their own incomes to the point where partners - fully qualified, senior medical doctors - are now taking home less than minimum wage.\n\nThe employer NI rise is the end.",

          "body": "Specifically there are two main problems I find with raising NI. I think a straightforward raising of income tax would've been a better option, the problem being that more obviously breaks the manifesto promise.\n\n\nThe first problem is that it's distortive. It increases the difference on tax rates between earned income, and non-earned income (dividends, rent, pension etc.). I find this both odd from an economic point of view (we are disincentivising work specifically) and a fairness point of view, especially given the emphasis on not taxing \"working people\".\n\n\nThe second problem is how regressive the change is. By shifting the threshold down from £9000 to £5000 you are effectively adding a ~£500 levy *per job* regardless of income (before you even raise the overall rate) - this is clearly going to be difficult for sectors employing low wage workers and will concentrate the effects of tax change more on lower earners. Again this is a step in the wrong direction tax-wise in my view.\n\n\nMy solution as given above if you want more tax is a straightforward raise of income tax. By this I mean the basic and higher rates. Your question mentioned raising the money from increased capital gains or £500k+ income taxes - the NI changes are expected to raise £25bn, and any changes to CGT or income tax at that level would struggle to reach that figure. A 1% income in additional rate tax is estimated to raise £210m a year; so it actually wouldn't be possible to raise £25bn from people warning over £500k only.",

          "body": "Almost any tax is better than employers NI.\n\n\nIt doesn't depend on profits and just adds a significant additional cost to ongoing operations. A cost which scales massively the larger workforce you have often disproportionately hitting low wage work.\n\n\nThis causes businesses which were profitable to suddenly find themsevles unprofitable and looking for job cuts and cutting hiring plans.\n\n\nConversely, employees NI might see the employee worse off but it doesn't actually harm their employment prospects or the profitability of employers business. So their job is safe.\n\n\nSimilarly Corporation tax only looks at profit. So a business struggling on minor profits doesn't see its expenditure suddenly skyrocket, it just loses a small fraction extra of its already tiny profits. A struggling business in this way can't be forced into insolvency as only profit is taxed.\n\n\nNI in general needs abolishing and rolling into income tax. The ring fence on NI which used to make it special were removed by Brown and its all just general taxationspending now. It's left there because it means labour can increase employers NI and say \"we TECHNICALLY haven't taxed workers\". Or so the tories can up employees NI and say \"we haven't TECHNICALLY changed the headline tax rate\".\n\n\nWhen the reality is both of them increased income tax just by shit backhanded ways and don't want to admit the headline tax rate is more like 40% base rate and 60% for higher rate.",

          "body": ">But from Attlee’s socialist commonwealth to Wilson’s “moral crusade” to the Blair-Brown mission to end child poverty, exorcising the demon of want has been the most serious purpose of Labour in power. Should this Labour government forget that this remains the unifying dream of its own political tribe then I would venture that, before too long, it will have a serious political problem.\n\nLets look at the numbers you wont discuss\n\n>Tax takes have been below the estimates provided by independent forecasters the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).\n\n>Tax receipts are now £11.4bn below the OBR forecast 11 months into the financial year while borrowing is £20.4bn higher.\n\n>This time last year, the government borrowed £117.5bn but the figure has soared to £132.2bn, a £15bn increase, ONS data showed.\n\n[UK government borrowing and spending defies expectations](https://www.msn.com/en-gb/money/other/uk-government-borrowing-and-spending-defies-expectations/ar-AA1BmHBe?ocid=BingNewsVerp)\n\nWe either raise tax or cut spending. The manifesto commitment was no tax rises. You want a serious discussion then be serious about the 18 year long financial crisis we have been in and be serious about the current global economy being a brewing shitstorm and the US basically aligning with Russia. \n\nBe serious or be ignored.",

Anything that a government does once, the same government (or a future one) will inevitably do again whenever they need a quick fiscal injection. This sets the precedent for the worst type of tax: one which is both arbitrary and unpredictable, and it will be priced in as such by the people getting taxed and markets in general. \n\nIn the report, the examples they cite are from 1940s and 50s, in very different economies. The more recent examples they cite were not wealth taxes at all. There's a reason no serious country does this anymore.",

It would be better if fewer people met this measure, but one is forced to wonder how you can expect an economy that doesn't grow to keep people out of a relative measure of poverty (one which 14m already meet before these measures). \n\nHistorically, £22k a year in today's money is a very comfortable lifestyle for people who cannot work, being entirely paid for by other taxpayers. Again, it'd be fantastic if we could give them more, but I think one part of the picture is we're just not recognising how difficult it is to give significant resources to an increasing number of people who cannot provide for themselves. \n\nYou also need to take into consideration that this assumes everyone who is impacted by the cut simply accepts it, rather than moves into employment, which seems obviously wrong.",

That's why it's so important to unlock growth so that more wealth can be created. \n\n>In some sense the wealth inequality also causes the stagnation in growth, it forces austerity on the masses which stagnates growth.\n\n[The evidence on the relationship between inequality and growth seems inconclusive](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215016121001953). There are lots of factors at cross purposes and also the possibility that the causation is the other way around - that stagnation causes inequality, not that inequality causes stagnation. There is, on the other hand, a range of factors that are almost universally understood by experts to improve growth - particularly around planning laws and regulations for building.",

This is a view that is vanishingly small amongst the electorate.

How can that be when there's all this talk of cuts? It's because of Pensions, of course. Pension spend goes from £151b a year to £182b in the next 5 years.\n\nAll this furore over £5b in welfare cuts, but when pensions go up £31b no-one raises an eye. Every year there is more pensioners, and more people closing in on pension age, so every year it gets politically more difficult (and more expensive) to cut the triple lock.",

Yet the thing I heard most about this budget was how it didn't involve a very specific £2bn plus policy, and heard a lot more about how significant this £5bn cut was than the £70bn increase last October was.\n\nWe are so clearly spending in the wrong places, and Labour is so far hesitant to actually shift our spending habits, but the media shouldn't get a free pass for its massively disingenuous presentation of anything any government does. I can sort of forgive the politically aligned papers for helping their side of the spectrum, but so-called impartial ones like the BBC are doing just as bad of a job at informing the public about what the government is doing.\n\nBased off the media response, you couldn't tell that Labour increased public spending 14 times their cut now, and that is a problem.",

There are now a significant number more people who require state help than previous, meaning we are becoming more disabled over time; or,\n\n2. What is sufficient to qualify for you for state help has changed to the point where too many are being included in a way that means we cannot financially support it.\n\nIf it is the first, we need to establish why and come up with a solution.\n\nIf it’s the latter, we have to decide whether or not it’s a reasonable thing to draw a line and say “the state does not deem you disabled, you get jobseekers and help back to work”.\n\nThis is outside the position of pensions, where we have seen significant increases in pensioner number and pensions.\n\nIt also doesn’t include the fact that so much more capital leaves the country because of foreign companies being such huge parts of our economy, and they utilise clever accounting to remove the capital as tax efficiently as they can.\n\nOr the fact that we have become a country of de facto monopolies and cartels (Amazon for non-grocery shopping, the supermarket/broadband/energy cartels, the big four banks etc).\n\nThere’s a lot wrong with our economy. It needs fixing, but it’s not doomed. It just needs a government with a large majority and the political will to move things forward.\n\nI would suggest tax reform should also be a priority idea (particularly business rates), but I’m not getting ahead of myself here.

It was instead released on Wednesday as part of the Chancellor’s Spring Statement.\n\nIt stated that by 2029/30 there will be 3.2 million families, including current recipients and some future ones who will financially lose as part of Ms Kendall’s reforms.\n\nThey will face an average loss of £1,720 per year once inflation is taken into account.\n\nThe document also stated that many of these will be pushed into poverty.\n\nIt said: “We estimate there will be an additional 250,000 people (including 50,000 children) in relative poverty after housing costs in 2029/30 as a result of modelled changes to social security, compared to the baseline projections.”\n\n**Full story:** [**https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/03/26/labour-to-push-250000-people-into-poverty-with-benefits-cut/**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/03/26/labour-to-push-250000-people-into-poverty-with-benefits-cut/)",

              "body": "PIP can be claimed while in work as it depends on disability impact rather than whether or not someone can work, so someone working part time and claiming PIP who then has it cut could then fall into poverty for instance.\n\nI think the UC changes, which are presently the benefit based on ability to work, are roughly due not to lead to more absolute poverty/relative poverty, because generally UC even with the health element doesn’t pay above the poverty rate - assuming a single person aged 25 on LCWRA living alone, they should receive around £809 a month plus the local shared accommodation, so around £1359 a month let’s say - or around £16,308. The absolute poverty rate is £347/wk before housing costs, so £18,044. I’ve also assumed a LSA rate of £550 there, but it can often be a lot less in poorer areas, or a lot more in places like London. So this shifts a bit depending on where you live \n\nOf course, there’s more nuance to it than that as this is different with couples etc. A lot of disabled people might also live with family so have reduced bills anyway. But generally a person with only UC with health element as their income would fall under absolute poverty. \n\nIt’s different of course if someone claims both - then that might push them a little over absolute poverty, so the cuts might push them into absolute poverty, it depends on the situation heavily. If I’m honest, I don’t really understand why PIP isn’t just rolled into the UC health element if they are changing it from an inability to work to a PIP-like impact of disability on life. We seem to have a penchant as a country for never truly wrapping up old benefits even when redundant and I wonder what impact this has on costs, considering the extra bureaucracy of it.",

Sure, I had to make do with older phones, TVs, consoles, etc. Sure, I felt the need to walk a mile or two rather than get the bus But it was... *fine.*\n\nI'm not joking when I said I only realised today that I grew up in *relative poverty*, because when I think of real poverty I do not think of someone who can afford modest holidays, modest takeaways, modest luxuries. I certainly grew up worse than most people I knew, I certainly struggled as a response, but if my experience of relative poverty is anything to go by, it's not disastrous.\n\nI think I agree with OP that relative poverty says very little. My life would not have been worse if the median income increased while my family's did not. The *only* thing that would have mattered was living costs. How much our shopping costs, our rent, luxuries and our occasional holidays, tutoring and school supplies. How much my friends nearer to the median income were make always meant *absolutely nothing* to me.",

However pushing people into relative poverty, when their standard of living improves, is however not a bad thing.\n\nWhen the financial crisis happened, the Ian Duncan Smith mentioned people in poverty decreased, due to those with money losing more of their share at the time. \n\nRelative poverty is a shit metric, people saying otherwise are not decent human beings.",

I never expected them to reverse it. I expected them to be better.\n\nThey have met that for me. They aren't constantly fighting themselves like the Sunak's Tories. They aren't pretending to be for me like Corbyn's Labour. They aren't playing protest like the LibDems or Reform (and at least LibDems are honest 'bout that).\n\nTo say Labour has ruined our economy is look at the last 17 years like it hasn't been a constant disappointment. I cam forgive Brown for only ever being able to respond to a global crisis, but the Tories has between 2010 and 2020 to do *something*, but rather than allow us to follow and surpass the US like New Labour did, they fell like Europe did. It's ironic they left the EU given that.\n\nI regret nothing. The only party I prefer at the moment is the LibDems, but they **know** they will never lead government. The Tories are nothing at the moment, while Reform and the Greens are just selling me fancy rhetoric with little substance. At the very least, Labour are selling me something real, and I just so happen to accept that we squandered our chance to be rich as the USA, and the Tories **chose** to be like Europe instead.",

Profits at supermarkets whilst not massively high are still enough to pay the big bosses substantial bonuses. \n\nEverywhere you look the average person is being ripped off. Be it by the government, employers, shops, landlords, internet providers, mobile operators, public transport costs, energy prices (there is more but I keep forgetting them) and SOMETIMES even your neighbours. That doesn't make us all assholes though. It makes a few of us assholes.

That a few do a lot better than average is again the norm.

The modern capitalist world has done more to improve the lives of the average person than every other system humanity has ever tried.  What that has also allowed and is different today is that we collectively support so many who can not support themselves.  For most of human history there was no support or help other than from close family/friends.

The vast majority of people here either commute, or are the few lucky ones who work from home for companies hours away. \n\nThe fact of the matter is that wages are low, and the cost of living is high.

Please allow me to explain.\n\nWhen trying to enter a high-paying industry in an area with low job growth; as most of the UK currently is; and high competition, your first job(s) will likely pay very little, but without it you will not get a foothold in the industry. Therefore, many people will need to pay high travel costs for low-paying jobs for the sake of the chance of a decent income later in life. It is an unfortunate circumstance that the privileged & elderly are often oblivious to.\n\nA second point that is worth noting is that the £5.4k is for the annual ticket. Those without that initial sum will end up paying for weekly or monthly tickets, which will cost £6.2k or £7k per year for this specific route. Therefore, I can assure you that in this aspect, I was already being very forgiving in my calculations.\n\nAs for average rent, I will admit that the UK average rent may be a bit much for this thought experiment, please feel free to propose a price that you belive is possible while following the limitations of 1. Unreliant on a second income. 2. Not living in poverty.",

          "body": "What I think we need are more \"Bank of Dave\" operations. (Dave Fishwick, Burnley Savings and Loan.)\n\nNot only is this operation using local money to help local people (boring things like simple loans to small operators) but Fishwick took down pay day lenders.\n\nChampion!\n\nBut what the shuddering feck does that have to do with a \"multibank\"?\n\nSimple.\n\nBoring stuff. Lend to local businesses who will hire people who are local and do local things for the locality.\n\nSure, they won't set the world alight with AI lug nuts that alert you before a wheel falls off, but they will provide services. Much needed services. Services that get shit done. That clear head space.\n\nMaybe \"Barry's Discount Boiler Bodgers\" can finally get a loan to buy that one piece of equipment and finally fix _whatever_ that clears the head space of the AI lug nut inventor.\n\nI dunno.\n\nBut I know one thing; you won't fix Britain front the top down, it's a bottom up kinda job. We need more Fishwicks. We need more rich entrepreneurs ready to actually *fucking* **give back** to the nation that made them.\n\nY'know, rather than bleed off what they can and piss off into the sunset. Paper patriots, if you will.",

              "body": "I agree that they need to give back, but not in the way many think (wealth taxes for example).\n\nWe need to change our tax laws such that entrepreneurial activity and job creation is massively encouraged, and passive investment and hoarding of assets that appreciate over time by doing nothing is discouraged.\n\nThis will force those with all the money to actually put it to use creating jobs and innovating again, rather than just buying land, property and shares (with the exception of shares issued in a capital funding round).\n\nMy opinion is lower corporation tax, and reduce cap gains tax to somewhere between 0 - 10% on selling a business or funding round purchased shares in a business that provides goods and services and creates jobs and value. \n\nMake cap gains on passive and extractionary business be in line with income tax bands.\n\nThis will incentivise both small and large business investment IMO.\n\nAnd of course zero cap gains tax on selling the home that you live in.",
