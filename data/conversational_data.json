All John Barrowman needed to do was put out on a sincere apology and he'd still have a career.

The only thing stopping people from just melting down the entire supply to make a profit is [Section 10 of the Coinage Act 1971](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/24/section/10) which states:\n\n>No person shall, except under the authority of a licence granted by the Treasury, melt down or break up any metal coin which is for the time being current in the United Kingdom or which, having been current there, has at any time after 16th May 1969 ceased to be so.\n\nI am curious about the legalities of sailing offshore (or just driving to Ireland) for this purpose as at some point it will become sufficiently profitable to do so.",

Also, it seems to me that the team around Starmer/Reeves has lacked the kind of talent that Blair could draw on - which might be a consequence of Labour having a fairly easy journey to power in the end.

We also had no economic strategy and still had the self-imposed ban on windfarms, immigration was allowed to build up and that stoked up social issues and more. \n\nStarmer took over at a very low point and is now getting grief because he hasn't made things magically better in nine months, if it was that easy then even the Tories would have turned things around. There's some commentary that he's been too cautious but I get the caution as a necessary means to get elected and things like the fiscal rules have hampered room to move. People like to make the comparison with Blair but took over a stable economy, there was no Ukraine war, we were in the EU, interest rates and inflation were stable and he didn't have a US president intent on causing global economic chaos. Blair though got grief by promising to stick to John Major's/Ken Clarke's spending commitments for two years after the election, many people then called him overly cautious and that we were losing an opportunity to act.",

Now, this will never happen obviously, and I don't actually know what we'd do in that situation.

That's it. This also explains all the absurd tariff rates you see imposed on other countries or territories, including a few where they've just blatantly forgotten obvious things like the fact that the Heard and Mcdonald Islands have no people on them to make the goods that would be charged a 10% tariff.\n\nNote: it's been well reported for a while that both the US and the UK claim a trade surplus with each other because of differences in how they measure trade (see [https://archive.is/XYN2r](https://archive.is/XYN2r) , much of the difference seems to come from the US not grouping crown territories with the UK which include much of our financial services exports). If the US were using the ONS's figures, that is a trade surplus of \u00a371.4b and exports to the US of \u00a3186.7b, the calculated \"tariffs on US rate\" would be 38.7%, halved to 19% to give the tariff.

In the 1980s we abandoned plans to replace and modernise our nuclear fleet due to high capital costs while at the same time North Sea gas became more viable for short term energy planning, and despite a brief flirtation with reviving those plans between 2008 and 2015 we've put it off because gas was so cheap.\n\n2. We've put off pumped hydro plans in Scotland and our transmission infrastructure is so old and outdated that we cannot effectively utilise our renewable capacity as there isn't though to efficiently transmit renewable power from (especially in Scotland) wind farms to high-demand areas in the south east of England, making us reliant on needing CCGT as that's the only thing that can quickly come online and scale to meet demand.\n\n3. The Eurasian gas markets are a lot more expensive now than they were a few years ago and we're very exposed to fluctuations in natural gas in that market as the British gas supplies are predominantly traded on that.\n\nSo basically, we're reliant on gas due to decades of can kicking on infrastructure investment for both generation and transmission. We're fixing it now (HPC, SZC, some dormant nuclear plans being lined up in the background, SMR, floating wind and fusion research, battery storage and solar farms in the south east, grid infrastructure upgrades like National Grid's \"Great Grid Upgrade\", new pumped hydro in Scotland) but it takes a while to fix decades of shit planning.",

Germany has about 3 months worth of natural gas storage and the UK has maybe a couple of weeks at a push so we're completely at the whim of the market whereas Germany can use reserves when gas demand on the market is high.\n\nTransmission infrastructure is probably the biggest reason though. We've gone from the old energy system where energy was produced pretty much everywhere to a significant chunk being produced solely in the North East and Scotland with wind turbines and the grid wasn't designed for up to 60% of the electricity at a time being produced in one area.",

If investors are reassured about our currency / economy / government, and see us as a safer bet, demand for the pound rises. Imports get cheaper. It's amazing how quickly things change, remember the run on the pound when Truss was PM? https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-63326809\n\n> The pound rose against the dollar and government borrowing costs dipped as the markets reacted to Prime Minister Liz Truss's resignation.\n> \n> Sterling hit $1.13 as Ms Truss made her announcement and rose higher in the afternoon before falling back to $1.12.\n\nversus:\n\n> US tariffs will only have a \u201cvery marginal\u201d impact on UK economic growth, according to Ales Koutny, the firm\u2019s head of international rates. That prospect and signs of stability in the gilt market are attracting investors, making $1.40 a \u201cvery achievable target by the end of the year,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\n> It\u2019s a level that the pound has only breached briefly since the UK\u2019s 2016 referendum to leave the European Union sent the exchange rate sharply lower.\n\nConversely, though, it does harm exports as our products get comparatively more expensive too, but if we buy more than we sell, net gain. Countries with the opposite set up can benefit from the other, like during the Eurozone crisis there was a lot of talk that the Euro made it more expensive for Greece to import, where as, Greece being in the Euro sandbagged the currency which benefitted German exports so they made fortunes from the weaker currency.",

On a macro scale this isn't necessarily a bad thing, some jobs and some businesses aren't productive and the long period of low interest rates following the Great Recession zombified a lot of the economy. To use a metaphor it's like cutting off some dead branches to bring a tree back to health again. That isn't to say I don't recognise that for those affected by it that it is a miserable situation to be in, just that on a macro scale it is higher interest rates doing what they're intended to do. \n\nHowever recent changes to employer national insurance rates and policy around thresholds are further compounding this misery, at a time when inflation is stubbornly falling, but growth is stagnant. We're teetering very close to stagflation, and arguably even in that zone if we remove immigration from the equation and look at growth on a per capita basis. However at the same time we have very little fiscal flexibility, when we desperately need it to re-arm our military, re-build our infrastructure, and fix our broken services. Fighting both inflation and recession simultaneously is extremely difficult, and it appears that growth has been put on the alter for the time being, which is the correct choice according to conventional wisdom. \n\nWe had 14 years of the Tories rearranging the deckchairs on a sinking ship, and it appears we now have at least another four years of Labour attempting the same. I get the government are being cautious and their options are limited, but the need to start looking at different approaches to bring back real growth, otherwise we're at risk of another decade of decline.

The message I took from it is that we need to let young boys be themselves more, and not pressure them into being stereotypically masculine and grown up (e.g the dad pushing him sports he wasn't interested in, or his classmates/social media making him feel he should be sexually active already).\n\nThe show was far more critical of our schools, the manosphere infuencers, bullyung etc than it was about \"young boys\".",

It seemed odd, then that he would decline to comment on the deal he crafted, when it's in the news more than ever. Right?\n\nOne of Badenoch and Jenrick's big claims is that \"Cameron halted the deal\" because of sovereignty. British Journalists have even repeated this claim, repeatedly saying Cameron halted the deal in December 2023.\n\nHere's Sky News Politcal Reporter Alix Culbertson repeating the claim:\n\n>[In December 2023, when David Cameron was foreign secretary, the talks were discontinued after a paper by three legal academics said transferring the islands would be a \"major self-inflected blow\" for the UK.](https://news.sky.com/story/uk-to-hand-over-sovereignty-of-chagos-islands-to-mauritius-after-decades-long-dispute-13227089)\n\n...Except that's not true. Cameron gave oral evidence at the Foreign Affairs Select committee in Jan 2024 confirming that negotiations were ongoing:\n\n>[When I was Prime Minister, it was all about trying to see if we could relocate Chagossians back on to the\nouter islands; lots of work was done, and it was not possible. It is exactly what I am asking. **As I say, there is a negotiation ongoing.** The absolutely crucial thing is the safety, security and long-term viability of this base in a difficult and dangerous world.](https://committees.parliament.uk/oralevidence/14047/pdf/)\n\nSo I do a time sensitive google of news stories, pre GE about Cameron \"halting the deal\". **You get nothing. Zero** \n\nIt's a lie made up after the fact by the Conservative party after losing the GE. If you think about it for a moment, after all it makes no logical sense for Cameron to renegade on a deal over sovereignty - when the entire premise of the deal he was negotiating was about handing over the islands to Mauritius and keeping the US base under lease. It would be like walking into a steakhouse for dinner by your own choice, and being outraged suddenly there's only steaks on the menu. Cameron patently still supports the deal, which is why he hasn't commented on it - out of courtesy for the Conservative party.\n\nThe wider point is. How bloody shocking is British Journalism? Do journalists verify anything anymore rather than repeat verbatim what they're told by political contacts?\n\n[I've been banging on for a while about how shocking and naive British Journo coverage of Chagos has been for months](https://old.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/1hzg94l/weekly_rumours_speculation_questions_and_reaction/m7a0pr1/?context=3), particularly assumptions around USA positions on it based seemingly of random vibes from Farage about what the Trump camp must think (so of course British Journalists think it must be true)\n\nIt's pathetic how little intellectual curiosity British Journalists have left in this country.",
