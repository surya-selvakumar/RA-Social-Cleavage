**The concept of paying people to sit around has an upside, writes Tim Harford.**

‘Swiss to vote on 2,500 franc basic income for every adult.” Reuters, 4 October 2013

**How much is that?**

It’s about £1,700 a month – over £20,000 a year.

**Payable to whom?**

Everybody, or at least, every adult citizen. It’s called a “basic income” and everyone gets it, no strings attached.

**You have to be joking**

We’ll have to see whether the Swiss think it’s funny or not – they are holding a referendum, which is something they do quite a lot. But the idea of a basic income suddenly seems to be back on the radar after many years of being out of fashion. The New York Times announced recently that at the cocktail parties of Berlin there is talk of little else; US policy wonks are getting excited about it too.

**This sounds like some communist plot. How can anyone take seriously the idea of paying people to sit around on their backsides?**

The idea is endorsed not only by experts on inequality such as Oxford’s Sir Tony Atkinson, but by the late Milton Friedman, an unlikely communist. The idea of a basic income is one that unites many left- and rightwingers while commanding very little support in the mainstream.

Currently I'm on JSA with depression, and the idea of taking a couple of hours' work is just too much to deal with, not the work, but the sheer bureaucracy involved with informing the DWP, the council, working out what sliver of my earnings I'd be allowed to keep, then find out my travel costs were more than my allowed earnings so I've lost money for doing a job, then on top of all that, my next needed benefit payment gets delayed for a month while the paperwork filters thru the system because someone's raised a 'doubt'.

Under basic income, I could spend an hour fixing a PC for someone, they could pay me a tenner, and it's all done, and I could accept it, instead of having to refuse money for my work for fear of being reported as some kind of welfare cheat.  They even say it's a 'thank you' for helping and not 'pay', but I am scared to risk it.  I'd also be able to do more volunteer work, without the DWP hunting me down for daring to spend 16 hours a week 'not actively seeking work', and instead doing something useful to society.

You'd find those who really didn't want to work wouldn't, and as such, wouldn't be a detriment to workplaces they were forced into.  Those who didn't want to work much could take part time work, and it'd mean there was enough work to go around, and those who crave luxuries, money or power can go for it, and carry on doing 60 hour weeks if they like.",False,False

If an employer can’t turn a profit on someone whose productivity falls below a legally mandated threshold, they simply won’t hire them, or else they’ll find ways to sidestep the law. While some argue that ‘studies show minimal impacts on overall employment,’ those figures tend to gloss over what happens at the margins, where the youngest, least skilled, or otherwise disadvantaged workers get shut out of the job market altogether. The fact that a broad statistical average doesn’t crater doesn’t help the individual who can’t break into that first rung on the career ladder because his productivity can’t justify the artificially inflated wage.

Those people, already struggling to offer what employers now demand, find themselves with nowhere to go but onto public assistance or into under-the-table work. Minimum wage laws and employment regulations, in this sense, end up shackling both employees and employers, preventing them from freely agreeing on terms that reflect actual abilities and constraints. By disrupting that fundamental freedom to negotiate, we create a class of individuals who become institutionalized into living off benefits or drawn to illegal enterprises. Unregulated trades like drug dealing or prostitution don’t ask for a résumé or insist on a government-approved pay floor, so it’s hardly surprising that many turn there when formal avenues are mandated inaccessable by law.

You can’t conjure higher productivity by passing a wage law. But you can raise the barrier to entry so high that those with limited skills are all but banned from the labor force, then act surprised when many resort to undesirable alternatives or end up trapped on welfare.

I think a system that allows even severely disadvantaged people in the UK to secure employment would be better. Because having a job, even a low paying one, contributes to ones people’s mental health, self-esteem, and future prospects. That first low-paying job often serves as a stepping stone to higher paid work later on, since it helps build the experience and skills that raise a person’s productivity level and attractiveness to employers.",False,False

Below are some thoughts on a bold economic experiment George Osborne embarked on that Labour has continued. No, it’s not austerity, but the big increases in the statutory wage floor.


>**The cost of ‘making work pay’**


>In 2015, Osborne did two things: he drastically cut back in-work benefits and significantly increased the minimum wage, setting the target that it would reach 60 per cent of median earnings by 2020. Since returning to office, Labour has continued that approach, with another chunky increase having come into force yesterday. This has drastically reduced low pay in the UK. Here’s the key chart from the Resolution Foundation


>When Osborne changed how the minimum wage worked, one worker in 10 had an hourly rate less than two-thirds of the median. Now just one in 29 do.


>I have to hold my hands up here. I did not think this was a good idea. I thought it was a good policy proposal that would exert too high a price. I thought shifting the balance of responsibility for supporting the incomes of working-age people between employers and the state would be bad for the economy, hurting smaller businesses and people at the bottom of the income distribution. I thought it would lead to more automation and therefore more unemployment, but that productivity would increase.


>That didn’t happen. But it’s worth stopping and thinking about Keith Fray’s terrific chart — the most important chart, I think, in British politics.


>Obviously I’m not saying that a change Osborne made to how the UK sets its minimum wage in 2015 is why the UK has had such bad GDP and productivity growth since the financial crisis. What I am saying is this: it is striking that it doesn’t appear to have done anything at all for UK productivity.


>We simply don’t know enough about why the UK has a higher number of people on sickness benefits than peer countries. But I continue to suspect one reason is that a consequence of the higher minimum wage is that work even at the mezzanine level of the economy has become much more intense. 
(We will get a big, useful bit of empirical research on this at the end of the year, though the Resolution Foundation’s analysis also suggests this.)


>Labour is doubling down on Osborne’s shift in responsibility, with not only an increase in the minimum wage but a rise in employers’ national insurance contributions.


>Increasing the minimum wage is a great lever to improve earnings at the bottom of the labour market. But, like all policies, it has costs as well as benefits.


>I continue to think part of why we have more young people not in employment, education or training (Neet) and why work has become more intense is that employers have responded to these increased costs by asking for more in return. That may be a price worth paying for a lower in-work benefits bill for the state. But it also has implications for working conditions and welfare expenditure.


>What drives the UK’s higher rates of sickness and inactivity among the working age population? Broadly speaking, among the young it is increased anxiety — which makes them a poor fit for a workplace that is becoming more intense. Among older workers it is physical ailments, which are causing people to drop out of the labour market a little earlier than their age of eligibility for the state pension. Increased workplace intensity has implications for these workers too, because it creates a colder world for people who are beginning to slow down.


>As I say, this is a good policy idea. But it comes with a price tag. Just as taxing everyone to increase tax credits is a good policy that comes with a price tag. And the costs of the new approach to “make work pay” may well pull against everything else Labour is trying to do.",False,False

Productivity is spurred by technological innovation and managerial decision making and adaptation. Every worker could magically somehow put 100% more effort into their job, and the producitivy gains translated into monetary gain would be minimal, because the inhibiting factor is the business decisions being made above their heads.

Anecdotal, but I work on a renewable energy production plant. The more productive it becomes, the less staff we need. Productivity was the opposite of being caused by workers. It was caused by investment decisions.

There are a lot of comments being made along the lines of ‘the minimum wage isn’t supposed to boost productivity’.

That isn’t the point the article is making. 

The point in the article is that if you raise wages, and do not raise productivity through whatever means, then there is less business case to hire the marginal worker (as you have to pay them more to provide the same output).

Consequently you have a degradation of employment of those marginal workers (what the article calls the ‘mezzanine economy’). And that is linked to the phenomenon we undoubtedly do see where labour force participation is eroding as more people go on the sick rather than working in lower-end jobs.

Behind this is the fundamental point that productivity ultimately drives wages. You can’t just magic up wages and living standards out of legislation and nothing else. It has to come from the output of goods and services we all (or some of us!) contribute to the economy. Over time, we can only consume what we produce. 

So if you want to raise wages for everyone, and not just compress living standards between the bottom and the middle, then you need to focus on boosting productivity and not policies like the minimum wage.",False,False

It actually fails to achieve what it is meant to by effectively making the vast majority of people poorer, especially at the bottom end of the income spectrum as more people get caught up in it or get ever closer.

When the min wage was brought in, it only actually affected about 0.5million people.  That number has now jumped to over 2million possibly as high as 2.5million right now. This is because min wage has risen much faster than average wage growth and at an above inflation level since its inception. It is estimated that by 2030 over 4million will be on nat min wage. 

This has had significant effects on the labour market, but most notably: 1. It has meant that money avalable for pay increases has been disproportionately funnelled toward min wage workers, resulting in smaller icnreases for lower paid (but not min wage) workers.  This effect is now so pronounced that even jobs that might have been considered semi skilled 20 years ago are now gettign close to being min wage. This results in alot of people being and feeling poor/er than they should be. 2. It results in inflationary pressure as costs of labor increase, makeing goods and services more expensive which just compounds people being/feeling poor/er, expecially at lower income levels. And 3. It directly contributes to housing inflation. Ultimately, because of the supply shortage of housing, landlords are going to charge the maximum (or close to it) they are able to charge.  By increasing min wage so far over inflation, landlords have been able to increase rents the most at the bottom end of the spectrum, which ripples upwards, increasing rents across the board, which then increases house prices as renting becomes more profitable. Therefore even though nat min wage has increased, housing cost increases effectively offset this, making everyone yet again be/feel poor/er.  

TLDR: Nat min wage needs to stop increasing at above inflation levels and go back to being a true minimum wage.",False,False

If an employer can’t turn a profit on someone whose productivity falls below a legally mandated threshold, they simply won’t hire them, or else they’ll find ways to sidestep the law. While some argue that “studies show minimal impacts on overall employment,” those figures tend to gloss over what happens at the margins, where the youngest, least skilled, or otherwise disadvantaged workers get shut out of the job market altogether. The fact that a broad statistical average doesn’t crater doesn’t help the individual who can’t break into that first rung on the career ladder because his productivity can’t justify the artificially inflated wage.

Those people, already struggling to offer what employers now demand, find themselves with nowhere to go but onto public assistance or into under-the-table work. Minimum wage laws and employment regulations, in this sense, end up shackling both employees and employers, preventing them from freely agreeing on terms that reflect actual abilities and constraints. By disrupting that fundamental freedom to negotiate, we create a class of individuals who become institutionalized into living off benefits or drawn to illegal enterprises. Unregulated trades like drug dealing or prostitution don’t ask for a résumé or insist on a government-approved pay floor, so it’s hardly surprising that many turn there when formal avenues are legally closed off.

So obvious that I’m confident this guy knows exactly what’s happened here and chose his “first six months of 2024” window very carefully.

First, yes it is true. In 2024H1 we brought 1,063 health and social care workers into the UK from Zimbabwe, and we granted 10,670 dependent visas.

If you look back to 2023 though it’s obvious why. Dependents don’t necessarily arrive at the same time as the main applicant.

Period | Main Applicants | Dependents
:-- | :-- | :--
2023 Q1 | 6494 | 5211 
2023 Q2 | 4717 | 5116
2023 Q3 | 4875 | 6831
2023 Q4 | 2641 | 7741
2024 Q1 | 758 | 8475
2024 Q2 | 305 | 2915
2024 Q3 | 451 | 1772

Main applicant visas dropped dramatically at the start of 2024 with the new visa rules, but dependent visas didn’t start to drop until Q2 (and based on the numbers I’m betting are still largely under the old rules).

Basically, the only way you could come to the “10 dependents” conclusion is to cherry pick exactly 2024 Q1 and Q2. 

I’m going to assume he’s not so stupid that he looked at those figures and thought “wow, the only explanation is that Zimbabweans have suddenly started bringing 10x more dependents in”.

So instead I’ll credit him with deliberately misrepresenting the facts in order to stir up ethnic hatred, he can fuck right off.",False,False

At-will employment means that both you and your employees maintain a working relationship for as long as it suits both parties.

\-a thorough understanding of why the Chancellor felt necessary and justified in the highly political tongue-lashing of the previous government for its ""hiding"" of the true state of affairs

\- why its felt to be optimal for the government to aggregate revenue and allocate it to a host of services in increasingly complex ways, rather than to think  of ways to allow individuals to retain more control of some of those decisions? Government share of the economy is at 44%.

\- whether people feel the demand for services (including the NHS) will stabilize at a level of GDP that will still enable the economy to grow

\- whether the Government (current and previous) have a theory of what drives growth, a vision of what type of economy and society they are aiming for, and whether its possible to meet the demands of the population as to both current needs and future positioning?

What's the betting that in a few years businesses have swallowed the rise in NICs and everyone has forgotten about it? 

Equally when legislation was introduced making it illegal to pay women less than men that too was anti-business and the predictions were that it would be counter-productive with fewer women being employed. That didn't happen. 

Companies that are successful are not going to like the extra tax but the trade off is if they see improvements in the economy and local infrastructure then that make it worth while. 

The government needed to raise a lot of money from somewhere and with £32bn of extra borrowing that meant tax rises had to come from somewhere with things like income tax and VAT and employee NICs ruled out that left a smaller pool of options - the last few weeks have seen a series of scare stories revolving around wealth taxes, cuts in IHT allowances, drastic rises in CGT etc with complaints that they were going to hurt business in someway.

The more minimum wage goes up, the more costs tend to go up and our wages are not rising in line with that. Yes, I can ask for a payrise and no, I probably won't get one because the whole of my industry is fairly in line on pay.

There's a gap between minimum wage jobs and highly skilled jobs (where you probably can threaten to leave and then get a raise). But that gap is quickly closing as we're slowly but surely pushed towards minimum wage.

Nobody is blaming minimum wage workers, obviously. But it'd be nice if there was at least an attempt to solve this particular issue millions of us face. Do we really think businesses are going to eat this cost, or pass it onto consumers with price rises (which many of us won't get payrises in line with) and pay freezes?

But university is still a good way for someone especially if they're from a poor background to have a better chance of landing something half decent, despite that the UK is a low wage nation yeah we need people to be binmen, work in shops etc but the pay along with cost of living is so crap that you'll be struggling to do anything with your life. Even for jobs that require university education for are not paid well. People often laugh that under the soviet union people barely had any money or any decent quality of life regardless if you worked in a factory, or a shop or was a nuclear scientist. We have the same problem especially when movement from within a company is non-existent so of course people are going to flock university because they have a better chance of landing a £26k job and job hopping every 2 years to increase their income than to start as a shop assistant.

Apprenticeships are no better either, because the Tories opened the floodgates of apprenticeships you now have companies like subway etc offering apprenticeships for a basic job. Before I decided to go to university I looked at apprenticeships and it was nothing but basic ""unskilled"" entry level jobs offered as an apprenticeship. Even my brothers couldnt get into a trade through apprenticeship they had to go to college for a few years first sidestepping apprenticeships. In some places you probably could but going into apprenticeship first to be in a trade or work in the energy sector etc etc is not universal.

Get a CSCS card. Go work on site. Earn significantly above minimum wage (given labour/skill shortages in construction, the pay these days seems relatively even higher).

It can also be pretty fun, varied (certainly more so than a lot of other minimum wage jobs), and a good way to gain a range of experience. If you don't like a particular job, it's easy to quit and find a new one. It'll most likely keep you reasonably fit, even if you're a slob outside of work.

I imagine it'd also do a lot of graduates some good to interact with people who (whilst being far more diverse than the stereotypes) are quite different to themselves.

And really, its like working will only be attractive to people from certain poorer countries. I've been halfway watching a cheap area of Europe to buy a house for a few years now, didn't buy because of Covid/Brexit and I'm not even 100% sure if it's viable to do if I don't have residency, maybe just a holiday home to share with family/friends. And the prices have not only stayed static in real terms, but absolute terms as well, in fact a lot of sellers periodically decrease the selling price of the houses.

So a house that was listed for 20k euros 6 years ago is still 20k euros today. Makes working in the UK attractive for people from these countries, or for Brits that want to live there.

Market forces exist no matter how much a government will pretend they don't.

Raising minimum wage well above the rate of inflation just flattens pay out for everyone else aside from the mega-rich. The companies that can't afford to give pay rises to their most skilled workers just won't raise pay in line with inflation let alone above it, because they can't afford to, and national stocks of money trees are at historic lows.

The companies that can afford to pay their skilled workers more will simply choose not to, because they're not obligated to. When pressed on the issue, they will explain that due to minimum wage going up so much, they can't afford equivalent pay rises for everyone else. This is likely untrue, but the truth of it is irrelevant, they will not raise pay. If I were some greedy venture capitalist shareholder, I wouldn't either.

People will say that companies will have to raise pay for their most skilled workers to avoid losing them to the competition, but that doesn't seem to be happening all that much. So how it plays out in a lot of cases is businesses comply with the minimum wage increases and then put everyone else's wage increases on hold or at least keep them very modest to see what happens.

Then... nothing. The reason for this is because business do not exist in a vacuum. They are aware of the competition, and are also aware that other businesses will follow the same process that they will. Their competition also complies with the minimum wage increase and also makes more modest raises to everyone else to compensate for this. So why would any business significantly raise the wages of their most skilled workers when no-one else is doing it either?

All this will do is shrink the gap between skilled and non-skilled pay even further. Which Labour probably doesn't see the issue with, except for the fact the only massive difference this will make is even more money will be funnelled into the hands of obscenely wealthy people.",False,False

Though the question is of course how we pay for it.  Although ‘fixing’ social care wouldn’t be all cost, making it an easily accessible quality service, would have a huge impact on the NHS including saving money.  It wouldn’t fix everything, but the NHS would be in an incomparably better place- with pressures eased on A&Es, wards and staffing- to say nothing of the cash savings.  Hard to exaggerate the impact of ‘bed blocking’ on our health service.   

Also worth pointing out that unnecessarily long hospital stays can actually make sick older people sicker-  For example greater chance of picking infections and the deterioration that such stays cause those with dementia, both of which put more pressure on healthcare.  More widely, good social care can keep people out of hospital in the first place, thus saving money. It keeps them engaged, with better health and allows for earlier intervention when an older person gets sick, possibly preventing a hospital stay.",False,False

The chief executive officer of electronics retailer Currys warned that the barrage of costs and red tape that retailers have to deal with will fuel inflation in the country.

Companies in the industry face higher costs due to a rising minimum wage and tax increases starting in April, as well as from a government proposal to stop retailers charging customers for recycling.

CEO Alex Baldock called on Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to change his mind on the recycling plan, saying it was too late to reverse course on the minimum wage.

“The biggest inflationary pressures are coming from government themselves,” Baldock said on a call with reporters.

“The combination of the minimum wage, the rate hike and some very misjudged proposals on recycling, all of them are adding to an already overburdened sector which is the largest private sector employer in the country and on which presumably we depend heavily in the UK to lead us out of economic difficulty,” Baldock said.",False,False

I know someone who works for the social aspect of employment and the company has said repeatedly that they want to pay her something for her time, but can't because what she does wouldn't be worth the cost to the company when you factor in minimum wage, holiday pay, and all the other nonsense that's required. So instead this women works for nothing.

The reason pay in the UK is higher than in say China, isn't because China hasn't upped their minimum wage enough, it's because their productivity sucks. If you want to increase productivity you have to encourage people to work, and when they do ensure they are working productively. I know someone who just today got 3 weeks fully paid off work because they've been feeling depressed. And perhaps that would be fine if say her mum just died or something but she does this every few months with no reasonable excuse. The company is obviously trying to get rid of her because all of this time off is costing them a lot and by proxy the employees who do work have to work hard to ensure the company stay afloat and there's enough money coming in for her sick pay, but again all the labour laws in this country make it difficult to get rid of people like this.

Truss is right as usual, but people in this country are likely too entitled to know what's good for them. If we want more holiday and higher wages we need to increase productivity and increase the labour demand so companies have to offer more attractive salaries and employee perks. More holiday pay and higher minimum wages reduce productivity in the economy so work against these goals.",False,False

----

TWENTY-FIVE years ago this month the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 was passed, receiving royal assent to go on the statute book on July 31, 1998.

The resultant national minimum wage was introduced on April 1 the following year.
It is viewed by many as one of the flagship achievements of the first “New” Labour government under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.

Indeed, it was a flagship policy of “New” Labour in the 1997 General Election manifesto that gave them a landslide victory, with a majority of 179 seats in the House of Commons.

With this majority, the only thing that could hold this Labour government back was its own politics.
So, after 25 years of operation, it’s a good time to look back and assess the effectiveness of the national minimum wage in ending or ameliorating low pay and poverty.

Prior to 1999, there was no singular national minimum wage. What limited wage regulation there was existed in the form of wage councils dating from 1945 for low-paid sectors such as retail where union organisation was weak.

These wage councils covered some 2.5 million workers, providing not just for minimum wage rates by age but also overtime rates. Consecutive Conservative governments in the 1980s and 1990s abolished these, with the last one for agricultural workers being ended in 1993.

Of course, the introduction of a national minimum wage was opposed by the Tories who wrongly believed it would increase unemployment by raising costs, so making firms uneconomic – that is, unprofitable.

When the national minimum wage was established, the rate for those over 22 years old was £3.60 per hour and. For those between 18- 21, it was £3.00 per hour.

In 2023, there are now five rates: £10.42 per hour for those over 23; £10.18 for those between 21-22, £7.49 for those between 18-20; £5.28 for those between 16-17 and £5.28 for apprentices. The national minimum wage makes no provision for overtime rates.

The National Minimum Wage Act 1998 was classic “New” Labour in that while it recognised and addressed a palpable problem created by the Conservatives and capitalism, it did so in a way that was way less than whole-hearted.

The act was a form of “light touch” regulation and not just because the rate was set so low at the beginning, but also because the enforcement of the minimum wage is so lax.

Although there were enforcement orders, there were no penalties paid by employers unless they failed to act upon an enforcement order. And, it was not until 10 years ago that the process of “naming and shaming”
employers not paying the minimum wage began. But the problems and weakness of the minimum wage are much greater than just this.

First, having different levels for different ages takes no account of the manifest reality that the cost of living for any adult is pretty much the same, no matter their age.

Second, and to re-inforce the point about the low rates, the “living wage” was created in 2011 by the Living Wage Foundation.

The “living wage” for 2023 is £10.90 per hour those aged 18 and older outside London and £11.95 in London. However, it is entirely voluntary and should not be confused with the attempt by the Tories to steal its clothes by changing the name of the national minimum for those over 23 to the “national living Wage” in 2016. Anti-poverty campaigners believe £15 per hour is the least that is now needed.

Third, there is more in-work poverty than ever before, with many claiming benefits in order just to try to make ends meet. This is the clearest indication that the national minimum wage has effectively legitimised low pay by giving it a statutory underpinning.

It also means the state is effectively subsidising low-paying employers by allowing them to pay this level, which then necessitates these workers to also claim benefits.

And, in the meantime as we all know, levels of wealth and income inequality continue to soar in Britain.
The case of the national minimum wage is as good an indication as any that the politics of “New” Labour was only to tinker around the edges with very limited reform and place far more trust in the so-called dynamism of the market to raise living standards albeit with a bit of finessing through a little “light touch” regulation.

The salience of this is that not only is the national minimum wage still in existence and still way too low but that it is also a harbinger of what a Starmer-led Labour government will do and will not do.

Starmer plans no changes to the minimum wage and has shown his fiscally conservative nature by lowering the expectations of what people can hope for from a Labour government. He is continually making clear that substantial and much-needed change is not on the agenda for Labour.

Worked at WHSmith while I was at uni and desperate for money with no student loan over summer. Worked at one of the airport ones. I wasn't there long, but long enough to see their toxic work practices and culture. They truly hate their staff.

I would have to pass through airport security to sign in to my shift, even if I was working in one of the arrivals stores. As a summer temp worker, I wasn't eligible to get a full security pass for the airport, so had to have somebody come down and collect me and take me through security for every shift. If I was scheduled to start at 2PM, I'd get to the airport at 1PM to give myself enough time to get through security and grab a coffee before work. But if my manager decided that it wasn't that busy, and they didn't need me just yet, they'd leave me waiting (sometimes for almost two hours) before they collected me and took me through security. I'd lose hours of pay *and* the shift would go down as an unauthorised lateness.

They wouldn't give you breaks at all. And if you did get one, a manager would find you in the break room after ten minutes and tell you it was time to get back to the floor.

My manager at the time was 20 and was on a contract where she was still getting minimum wage for her age bracket until she passed a six month probation. The six month mark comes around and they tell her she failed probation so they have to extend it. I was 21, so I was being paid more than my manager, who was doing the work for a year without being compensated for it.

One of the lads who started the same time as me was 16, and was scheduled to work shifts alone in one of the stores. He obviously would be selling lottery tickets and cigarettes, which he was legally not allowed to do at 16. When I raised a concern about it, I was shut down and told that he can do it and that he's happy to do it.

At the end of shift, they'd have to scan every single unbought sandwich from the chillers and put them in a big bag ""to be sent back and counted"". If you took one of the sandwiches, you'd be fired for stealing because they ""need to keep them for stock keeping"". One shift one of the managers asked me to follow him with a bag of sandwiches cause there was more than usual and he couldn't carry them alone. We chucked them all in the bin. They didn't let the staff take any because they wanted the staff to pay if they wanted to eat anything there.

There was one manager who would get in early, sit in the office with the lights off and watch the cameras. He'd also single out members of staff that he thought were weak (usually young girls) and berate them. One girl I worked with was brought to tears every single day, and ended up quitting because none of the other managers would do anything about it.

In the departures stores, customers are required to scan their boarding passes at the checkouts. We were told that the purpose of this was market research, so they know how to better serve customers in different terminals. While I was there, Metro published a story about how WHSmith's don't have to pay VAT if their airport customers are going to certain destinations, and that's the real reason. Suddenly I have loads of angry customers at my checkout accusing me of stealing their money and not passing the VAT saving onto the customer. Ofc the company was happy to chuck their minimum wage workers under the bus and let them take the flack for it.

Awful, awful place to work. Probably could go on, but I don't. Special mention to the customers at WHSmith airport stores, though. Truly the worst collective group of people I've ever dealt with.",False,False

Oh no sorry, it’s their usual shite and race baiting! It’s late, I must’ve confused them with a reputable news source, my bad.

I’m just gonna cherry pick because this entire article is awful…

The report is titled “Structurally F*cked”…well I can’t wait to read this! I’m sure this will be comprehensive and unbiased!

“Industria, the shared name of two artists who co-authored the report after surveying more than 100 peers”…oh. So it’s self-reported, and there’s clearly no margin of error at all here, super duper!

“Of those surveyed, 76% reported fees below minimum wage, while 74% of respondants said they felt the artist fee received was unfair in relation to the scale of the work.” 

So there’s some weird numbers that they don’t dig into. I’d bet a good portion of any sector feels their pay is unfair in relation to the scale of their work. But only 74% feel it here, bearing in mind that 76% are also being paid less thanminimum wage…? What? Do they just value their work as being worth less than minimum wage? Don’t make no sense to me.

“[the report calls for a £15 minimum wage]”. Weird that. I wonder where they got that £15 figure from? Could it be from an American movement that they’ve just copied, without taking into account…well, literally anything? Even currency exchange rates? Strange how often this number pops up with absolutely no rationale behind it.

The shit star on the top of this shit-tree of an article is surely this though: 

“Others spoke of an exploitation of artists of colour, with one saying: “I haven’t started the project yet and I’m already dreading it and the amount of time and effort [i will] put in. I regret taking it now, if I’m honest. I hate the normalisation of exploitation in the arts in the UK, especially as a black artist.”

So we have somebody who hasn’t even started yet, but hey, they’re black, so why should they bother? It’ll be easier to race grift after they do no work then try to make a race issue out of it when they’re not paid for all that work they didn’t do, than just do the work surely.

Honestly, I can't figure out *why* he's in Parliament. He's been an MP for a quarter of a century, yet rarely speaks in the Commons, doesn't speak out in the media, has seemingly no firm positions beyond those the party says he needs to parrot, and isn't active in the constituency.

He does tens of thousands of pounds worth of declared private work every year, and inherited fat stacks from papa. He has no need for the salary or status of an MP, and does nothing with his position. 

He's the very definition of a bench-warmer.

I wouldn't be surprised if the Tories chuck him under a bus, given that Huntingdon used to be John Major's seat and they probably want to shore it up with fresh blood before the next GE.

Obviously those already paid over the current £9.50 minimum wage and up to £15 would want to keep that differential premium and be paid that on top of the £15, and so someone earning say £12.50 would now be expecting between £18 and £20. 

Then those earning over £15 would also want a similar 58% increase to maintain the differential to reflect the skill and effort their work demands. 

With a 58% pay increase for a large part of the workforce, that is going to be pretty inflationary as those increased wage costs are passed on in higher prices to consumers. 

Those employers who can’t increase prices to cover that 58% increase in wage cost will be shedding employees and demanding higher output from those remaining. 

Turning to pensioners, then with the ‘triple lock’ the increase in average earnings is going to increase their payments significantly. 

But then you have those on out of work and disability benefits who don’t benefit from the ‘triple lock’ and will only see their benefits increased by inflation - although that will still be significant. 

With increased unemployment and the pressure on government finances from their wage bill being significantly increased then it is likely that there would be no money to increase benefits to match the wage increase so those on benefits would fall into greater relative poverty.",False,False

It would necessitate such a huge uplift in the wages of those earning slightly to moderately more than £15 per hour.

£15 per hour * 37.5 hours per week = £562.50 per week * 52 weeks = £29,250 annual salary

With that kind of increase, why would anyone but the most dedicated stay in a career that entailed significant stress and has large costs associated as a barrier to entry (e.g. degree or professional qualifications)?

If you were a nurse or a teacher or a junior doctor and saw people without degrees and significant debt, as a result of your training, earning the same or more than your starting salary in a job with less stress and shorter working hours, would you stay put?

An increase of this magnitude might be doable over a 3-5 year timescale, but it would require all other jobs to incur a similar increase in wages.

Personally, I think something like a UBI would be better. £600 a month to all adults, regardless of other benefit entitlements etc. This wouldn't be enough to live on, but when combined with benefits it might be (certainly better than today), and for those in work it would take the pressure off, and could be used to stimulate economic growth.

I guess many would argue that they'd do away with tuition fees, too, but that still doesn't negate the time and effort spent by individuals who become skilled workers.

George Osborne, then Conservative chancellor, announced the minimum wage for over-25s would accelerate sharply to reach 60 per cent of median hourly pay by 2020. His decision was linked to his determination to cut welfare spending. But he also argued the intervention would boost the economy’s stubbornly poor productivity performance.

That argument about productivity has become increasingly popular since then as more countries contemplate higher wage floors. It is easy to see the allure in the notion that one good thing (better pay for those at the bottom) can lead to another (a stronger economy overall).

The idea is that if employers are no longer able to rely on cheap labour, they will have to invest more in capital or increase workforce productivity with better technology or training. It also has some empirical support. One paper has found that Germany’s minimum wage increased productivity after its introduction in 2015, albeit by driving some smaller companies out of business.

But the British experiment has not stuck to the script. A review by the Low Pay Commission last week concluded the policy “did not improve productivity”. Industries and areas with a higher share of minimum wage workers did not experience faster productivity growth, relative to other areas, after the policy was introduced in 2016.

Why didn’t it work out? Surveys of employers showed they were keen to boost productivity initially, but their enthusiasm faded over time. More decided to simply accept lower profits or charge higher prices. Smaller companies, in particular, struggled to find money to invest. In surveys by the Federation of Small Businesses, the third most common response to the rising minimum wage was actually to cut or cancel investment as a way to cope with higher costs. The LPC review said some companies which did invest found the technology they used was inflexible or disliked by customers.

When I was reporting on the introduction of the higher minimum wage in 2016, I was struck by how many employers said they would make staff work harder rather than smarter. One hotel owner told me he would make the cleaners do more rooms per hour, for example. An employer survey in 2019 bore this out: 25 per cent of respondents had asked staff to do more tasks (the most popular “productivity-related” response) compared with 11 per cent which had automated tasks.

But this is a poor man’s version of productivity growth. It might work for a while, but people can only work so hard before they burn out or deliver a worse quality product or service. Low-paid work in the UK is already more stressful than it used to be. The share of employees who report that their work is “always” or “often” stressful rose from 30 per cent in 1989 to 38 per cent in 2015, according to the Resolution Foundation think-tank. But for people in jobs such as driving or care, the proportion has risen from 18 to 41 per cent.

Higher pay at the bottom has also compressed the wage ladder in some companies. Employers interviewed by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said smaller pay differences between entry-level and supervisor jobs was making it harder to persuade workers to take on more training and responsibility. “What we get reported back is people saying, ‘I’m taking on all this extra responsibility, and that person who has just joined us in a lower-skilled role is on the same pay scale as me. Why should I bother?’” explained one executive at a leisure company with 3,400 staff.

None of this is to say Osborne’s minimum wage policy has been a failure. It successfully raised pay for people at the bottom of the labour market without causing high unemployment — a feat some economists doubted would be possible. The 50/10 ratio of pay — a measure of wage inequality for the bottom half of workers — fell by more between 2015 and 2019 than in the previous 17 years.

Minimum wages can put more money into the hands of workers who need it and will spend it. They can help address concerns about fairness and inequality. But these undeniable achievements aren’t completely costless. And they are not guaranteed to transform a country’s productivity growth, at least not when other trends and policy choices pull in the opposite direction. Spending on adult education in England, for example, was cut 49 per cent between 2009 and 2019.

If Britain is to be a “high pay, high productivity” economy, it will need more than the minimum wage to get there.",False,False

ONE OF THE pre-budget leaks—designed to ensure positive press in advance of the big event—was that the minimum wage would rise from £8.91 ($12.23) to £9.50. This will lift the pre-tax pay of a full-time worker by £1,000 a year from next April, in keeping with the government’s promise to deliver a high-wage economy. Yet if the politics of the move were obvious, the economics were less so.

The Low Pay Commission (LPC), a group of economists, employer representatives and trade unionists, has advised the government on the minimum wage since 1997. In recent years the government has given it increasingly ambitious goals. The latest, which it received in 2020, was to work out how to put an end to low pay altogether, defined as earning below two-thirds of the median hourly wage.

Previous changes have yielded results. The share of people on low pay fell sharply from around 23% in the 2000s and early 2010s, to just 15% in 2019. But it is uncertain whether further climbs will be as easy. Across the OECD, a club mostly of rich countries, only Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica and Turkey have minimum wages with a sharper bite.

Worries about the new target paled into insignificance when the covid-19 pandemic struck. The quality of the data available to the LPC plummeted, and the furlough scheme muddled average earnings figures by replacing 80% of people’s pay. A year ago the commission’s best guess suggested that staying on track to meet the target would have implied raising the minimum wage to £9.06. Given the extent of the uncertainty, they instead advised the government to apply an “emergency brake” and to raise it to just £8.91.

The impact the minimum wage had on the labour market during the pandemic is still unclear (when asked, businesses told the LPC they had no idea). A glance at the data suggests the commission was maybe too pessimistic about employers’ capacity to absorb higher wages, as its latest estimates show the number and share of workers paid the minimum wage have fallen slightly. But that same observation may also suggest they were correct to be cautious, since it could be that the lowest-paid workers were more likely to lose their jobs.

The LPC’s latest estimate is that achieving the government’s goal means the minimum wage will need to reach £10.70 in 2024. A number of factors support the case for a meaty rise now. Inflation is higher than usual; earnings growth is strong, particularly in sectors where pay is lowest; unemployment is relatively low in places with lots of minimum-wage workers; and businesses do not seem to be planning waves of redundancies.

Next year’s rise is almost—but not quite—on course to hit the target. The slightly cautious increase the LPC and chancellor ultimately plumped for reflects concerns about other business pressures looming in April, including a rise in National Insurance contributions and the end of tenants’ protection from eviction. Despite long-standing fears, higher minimum wages have yet to noticeably increase unemployment. But no one wants to reach the point at which they do. ■",False,False

It is the same with the universal credit uplift... £20 * 52 * 5M = £5.2B. This is the quoted cost... but this supports jobs. A significant amount comes back in VAT, income tax and corporation tax.

If you accept that they get accommodation paid for on expenses, then obviously it follows that they can pay the *whole* cost on expenses. That includes council taxes. And when council taxes go up (as they do every year), so too will their expenses claim.

If any of the Telegraph's furious readers have their second home as part of an employer benefit, they can expect the same treatment I'm sure. Whereas if their second home is a shag pad in Cornwall which they go to 4 times a year, then I'm sorry but they're probably expected to pay for it all themselves...",False,False

I know land value taxes get plugged here all the time but in this specific case I think an LVT replacing council tax makes concrete sense rather than just being a knee-jerk anti-landlord stance, it would reflect the reality of the property market more accurately while raising the money more efficiently. It’s also a built-in NIMBY deterrent to some extent, since you’re being taxed on the unimproved value of the land there’s direct incentives to build something productive versus keeping something unproductive around. Combine this with taking social care out of the hands of councils in favour of a national care service and we might be able to make a dent in the urban rot that’s growing throughout the UK.",False,False

It's always the biggest challenge for politicians of any party at any level of government. The fact is, over the last few years most councils couldn't keep up with inflation and now need to make up the deficits to avoid bankruptcy, especially now that councils are responsible for so many responsibilities that were once managed by central government. Bankruptcy would be deeply irresponsible, while services are usually cut to the bone as it is, so not much can be saved by austerity. 

For an example of what happens when they don't do this, look at the Tories in Buckinghamshire. They're only putting it up by 3% rather than the 4.99% they are allowed, probably because it's an election year. The result? The council is now £10m short of the money needed to provide assistance to children with learning difficulties, who will now fall further behind in school as most families with such children now wait more than 20 weeks just to get a plan in place, let alone the help they really need.

On the one hand, it shows the Tories in Bucks care more about elections than disabled kids getting the help they need in school. On the other, it shows how difficult any party finds it to fund their council without raising tax by 5% a year.",False,False

The fact that not even one council is holding a referendum and some like Somerset have written to the government to beg to increase council tax by more than 5% without a referendum just shows they don't want to listen to voters. 

They effectively have three choices. Have a successful 'Yes' referendum to a large increase in council tax, cut non-statutory services, declare bankruptcy.  If the public don't like the first option, then one or both of the other options is what should happen. At least the decision which option to pick would have democratic legitimacy if councils actually engaged with the referendum process.

You hate their pensions? That's cool - they're only so generous (as in, literally nowhere near as generous as they used to be) because it's a widely accepted trade off for the shit pay. But hey, we can solve that if you'd like, guys - by paying wages commensurate with the private sector. As a planner, I earn very close to £100k a year quite easily in the private sector if i'm half decent at my job and willing to manage one or two juniors - that'll be for fewer hours and cases than working for an LPA, too.

It's not really forcing people to sell the second homes. 

It's people listing the properties at an inflated price just to avoid paying council tax.

It's a case that the policy of increasing council tax on second homes has caused people to look at tax avoidance. 

What's not listed in the article is another popular method that many second homes which are used for holiday let's (min 10 weeks a year) can opt to pay business rates instead of council tax and seek up to 100% relief.

This can then be spent on services that benefit the community.

Even if the stated policy aims aren't achieved in the slightest, this sounds like a win?

Very astute of the second home owners to acknowledge their part time support of the local market and that their surplus house value is out of reach for people attempting to buy their very first house.

Of course, economics would suggest that should they ever become serious about selling their houses, they will have to lower prices. At which point maybe first time buyers can afford it, or maybe people who already own a first house may be able to upsize, gaining a house that better suits their plans whilst freeing up a starter house from people who haven't bought their own. If the area in general becomes more affordable, people will move there (full time) and support the local economy (full time).

I hate using phrases like this, but honestly the suggestion that your part time patronage is the only thing keeping a local economy going reeks of main character syndrome.

On the question at hand, this feels like it should be a UK wide policy tbh... even large corporations buying houses out to rent is better for the housing market (and, should we stoop so low as to look at what is underneath the economics of it all, actual humans who need somewhere to live their lives) than second homes.",False,False

Four million pensioners living alone are at risk of a council tax raid under Angela Rayner at the same time as they face [losing winter fuel payments](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/09/05/winter-fuel-rebellion-small-taste-welfare-battles-to-come/).

Retirees make up around half of the 8.4m people who will be affected if the Housing Secretary abolishes a council tax break for one-person households, analysis shows.

Ms Rayner, the Housing Secretary, this week [refused to rule out scrapping the 25pc sole occupier discount](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2024/09/02/angela-rayner-refuses-rule-out-single-tax-discount-cut/), which cuts around £543 per year from the average Band D council tax bill in 2024-25.

Scrapping the single-person council tax discount would save the public purse around £3bn a year, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).

But pensioners warned that removing the discount would be an “unforgivable betrayal” of older people and could mean they lose their homes.

It comes after Rachel Reeves, the Chancellor, announced she would scrap winter fuel payments worth up to £300 for 10m older people.

The logic goes like this: punitively raise council tax on second homes, encouraging them to sell, making housing more affordable for locals.

But here's the issue: these houses are poorly suited to locals (expensive to maintain, lack space, access to schools) and a far better suited to being... holiday cottages. 

So what's happened to the former holiday cottages? Well they're either sitting empty OR rich (non-local) retirees have moved in, straining local services. There's been no effect on housing affordability for locals - because fundamentally those aren't the houses they want or need. Not only that - money from tourism has started to crater as they get a smaller and less reliable trickle of visitors. So in short: 1) locals haven't got more affordable housing 2) there's increased strain on local services from rich, old retirees moving in. 3) the local economy has been hit by less tourism. 

So what's the solution? **We build more houses**. The houses that people need, in the places they want to live. 

The UK has the lowest second home ownership rate in Europe. Second homes, short-term lets, Air B 'n' Bs are not the enemy. They make holidays more affordable. Holidays shouldn't be the preserve of the rich. Going to a nice coastal town for a weekend break should something we **all** can enjoy.",False,False

But that has calculated the impact:

>A continuous and proportional council tax system would be more progressive with respect to income and, of course, property value. The lowest-income 10% of households would see their average tax liability (net of CTS entitlement) fall by £60 a year, equivalent to 0.5% of household income. Households in the third decile group would see the largest fall in average bills, by £190 a year (0.9% of income), as they are less insulated from changes in council tax by CTS. The highest-income 10% of households would see their average bill rise by £750 (0.7% of income) a year.

So it can't be the national average - maybe it's the very top 1% of households, who I'm guessing can probably make that extra £100 a month without starving too badly.

The issue is that council tax is just one element in a bigger problem, and people get distracted by issues such as the banding being based on 1991 prices which is a largely irrelevant matter. 

Council funding comes from four sources, around half from council tax, just more than a quarter from retained business rates (not the whole of business rates are kept by the council) and just less than a quarter from government grants, and the fourth source is revenue generated by the council but this can vary wildly from one to another. 

Over the last 15 years the government grants have been reduced, and the government placed caps on the increase that the council could impose on council tax unless they held a local referendum. 

And in addition, councils (unlike central government) are prohibited from borrowing to cover day to day spending. 

Now combine all of that with the issue that there are some wealthy areas, Westminster council for example, that have low costs for many expensive social issues, plus lots of retained business rates and having a huge amount of income from parking, and they can set their council tax low irrespective of what the bands are. 

Compare that to councils in deprived areas with high demands on expensive social issues, low amounts of retained business rates and damn all from revenue, and you can see that doing anything with council tax alone doesn’t fix anything. 

Now you could simply get councils to hand over 100% of council tax, business rates, and revenue to central government, and have central government hand back money wholly as grants, but that pretty much destroys local democracy - and would you have wanted the Conservatives to have had that power over all the Labour and LibDem councils over the last decade?",False,False

I’m finding it frustratingly banal how the media are focused on trying to catch him out on something a lot of people admit they think needs to happen (increase tax to increase spend). Rather than actually looking at his other policy. 

Council tax does need reform, but it’s going to be really hard to do that in a meaningful way without raising normal tax (because CT is only a fraction of Council budgets) or take aspects out of council funding (Adult Social care) altogether. Taking ASC away from Council budgets would massively improve Councils, but you would still have to fund that separately.

One option would be to say that 24.1% of homes (in England) are in band A, 19.6% in band B, 21.9% in band C, 15.6% in band D, 9.7% in band E, 5.1% in band F, 3.5% in band G and 0.6% in band H. You could revalue homes based on their current value to create new bands matching those percentiles, i.e. keeping the same number of properties in each band. This would considerably increase the tax burden in regions which have experience greater property value increases in the past 30 years (London and the South East) and reduce the burden in other regions.

Likewise, you could propose reforms without doing any revaluation. You could simply use a weighted average to equalise rates across all councils. Here you’d see an increased burden in places that are known for low rates of council tax (e.g. Wandsworth, Westminster), and a decrease in tax burden on places with high rates (e.g. Rutland, Kingston-upon-Thames).

Obviously, the flip side to areas and regions seeing increase/decrease in tax burdens is that they also see a decrease/increase in funding for local services.

But to keep local funding the same, you would have to (do either or both of) allow localities to value similar properties in different bands and/or rate different bands at different ratios. Both of those would create a much more severe postcode lottery when it comes to council tax (and would require significant oversight to ensure such changes are revenue neutral).",False,False

Coincidentally, there was a recent video by that Gary Stevenson, and while I'm sceptical of him and his analyses (too reductive?), he made a fair point about the dereliction of towns being caused by inequality - poor people chasing the money of rich people resulting in geographical concentrations of people and these humongous [mega] cities while smaller towns/cities suffer from this inequality. He gave the example of Colombia and how it has several megacities with hoardes of relative poorer folk living and competing for money of the rich in the centre (or in pockets). Building more houses won't solve the problem which I can kinda get. One might even say that the housing market, while distorted, is one of the only markets that is relatively more perfect (i.e., not oligopoly nor monopoly). 


The reason I'm using this is that it seems that we're trying to tackle a symptom of the issue and not the issue itself. So, what is the underlying issue? Is it inequality? Or is it something else... Is it productivity/unproductive (or suboptimal) resource allocation? Or is it urban planning? Or is it large conglomerates trying to pull up barriers to entry in the market [against atomised operators]? Hmm...

However it's usually the very locals complaining about lack of housing for their small communities that built and sold these houses on the open market. Builders from those towns will have made fortunes! 

Hurting the players won't fix the game. If you did your time working hard for this country and earned your wealth fair and square, why shouldn't you be allowed to invest it and enjoy it? 

There's also housing crises in many UK cities where people who grew up in even seemingly less desirable areas are being forced out of where they grew up. The problem is not restricted to idyllic spots. 

Seems unfair to tax people for playing by the rules of the game.

It also will not solve the housing crisis. These houses could be sold on the market tomorrow. Unless people want communism, they'd sell at market rate and there's a good chance they'd just become another second home for someone with the money to buy it (rather than locals)...that's capitalism for you.

What the government needs to do is tax landlords in particular, (there's more of in the UK than there are teachers) and build more.

Too few houses to buy:Too many to rent (but there's also too few to rent overall, which keeps rents high also). Buying and rental markets are like yin and yang.

In 1989 Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative government introduced the “poll tax”, an average annual charge of £392 (£934 or $1,190 in today’s money) on every voter. It was very unpopular, leading to violent clashes with protesters in London, and contributing to the ousting of the prime minister eight months later.

Three decades on, the levy that replaced Thatcher’s poll tax is also in trouble. Council tax is among Britain’s most regressive. It pays for services used every day. In 2023, 296 local authorities raised nearly £40bn—half their funds (the rest comes from central government)—from 25m householders in England. It pays for services such as social care, which accounts for half of their spending and the growth in which is partly why fixing local-government finances is so urgent, but also schools, policing, libraries and much else. On December 6th the Local Government Association, a club for local authorities, said that as many as a fifth of them risk financial collapse. On November 29th Nottingham’s council had become the fifth local authority in a 12-month period in effect to declare bankruptcy.

Council tax was always badly designed. In April 1993, all 20m homes in England were sorted by their estimated market value on April 1st 1991 into one of eight bands (A-H). The tax is still assessed on that value. As Stuart Adam of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), a think-tank, says: “We wouldn’t tax people based on what their jobs paid 30 years ago. It is just ridiculous.” 

In Scarborough, a seaside town in north Yorkshire, a 1930s three-bedroom semi-detached flat sold for £200,000 in May; in Hackney, in London, a two-bedroom flat built 15 years ago sold for £750,000 in July. But for council tax, both homes are in band C, valued at between £52,001 and £68,000 in 1991 prices. In short, 30 years of differential house-price inflation have made the valuation bands meaningless.

The absurdity does not end there. How much money local authorities receive from central government is calculated on a Byzantine formula unchanged since 2014. It takes into account local authorities’ ability to raise revenues from council tax, but only as of 1991. Local authorities must then set their council-tax charge according to how much tax revenue they need.

The system is riddled with distortions. Council-tax charges for band-D properties vary from £914 to £2,422. Or, to take an extreme example, Buckingham Palace, valued at around £1bn, sits in band H and is charged £1,828 by Westminster City Council, less than an average three-bedroom semi in Blackpool. In fact this year 46% of households in England will receive a bigger council-tax bill than the Palace.

That helps make council tax such a regressive levy. 

A home valued at £1m is charged just 0.2% of its value each year, on average, whereas a home worth £250,000 —  the median value — is charged three times that rate. 

According to calculations by the IFS, in 2019 council-tax bills for the poorest 10% in England accounted for one tenth of take-home pay. For the richest 10%, it was just one-fiftieth.

There are three approaches to fixing the council-tax mess. One would be indirect: amending the formula that Whitehall uses to dole out central-government funds for local services. Grants could be allocated to reflect local authorities’ current tax bases and needs. Local authorities would then have to adjust their council-tax rates to reflect the change. But a “fair funding” review of local government to effect this adjustment, promised by the government since 2016, was recently delayed again.

A more direct approach would be a revaluation of the 25m homes in England, and legislation to ensure that those values are regularly updated. In 2019 the IFS estimated that such an exercise would result in very little change in council-tax bills for four-fifths of households. Revaluation has been tried before, but apart from in Wales, where the Labour-controlled Welsh government in 2005 introduced new council-tax bands and will do so again in 2025, the system remains unreformed.

In 2022 the Conservative government conducted an internal review of council tax. But in December it said that any reform will wait until after the general election. The Labour Party, perhaps fearful of losing middle-class votes, has said little about it.

But amending valuations alone would be a partial fix at best. A complete overhaul might be needed, such as replacing the bands and charging council tax as a fixed proportion, say 0.4%, of a home’s value. The IFS has estimated that fully 70% of households in England would pay less under such a system. The richest 10% of households would be on the hook for an additional £750 per year. It would also require far more redistribution from Whitehall to the regions beyond the south.

Still, executing reform could be tricky. Assessing the true value of homes would be contentious, and the right-wing press would be up in arms about a “wealth tax”. The asset-rich, cash-poor losers would shout far louder than those set to gain a few hundred pounds a year.

Perhaps it is the memory of the riots in 1990 that has caused such inertia at Westminster. Now, three decades on, reform is becoming unavoidable. But Michael Heseltine, who as secretary of state in 1991 introduced the council tax to the House of Commons, counsels caution. Lord Heseltine remarks that “no government considering a revaluation has ever won a subsequent election”. Torn between maintaining an unpopular, regressive tax and even more unpopular attempts to improve it, successive governments have let its inequities worsen by the year. ■",False,False

This ultimately has to be the solution; but the number shouldn’t be set centrally. Having it controlled from the centre opens it up to same issues on accountability.

Local authorities should be able to set their own rates and do it on a progressive system so more expensive houses can have higher tax rate; you could even share HMRC data so they can introduce deferments based on income. 

That way local government has both the levers to raise money and responsibility to deliver services instead of going cap in hand to central government. They can make decisions around longer term investments, and people will actually care about their councils.

You’ll need some temporary redistribution via central government precept between local authorities but that needs to be time limited (over say 25-50 years) so local authorities have a deadline to invest and become more self reliant. 

It’s either that or take responsibility into the centre and turn local authorities into glorified local contact offices.",False,False

Still, the tax itself is regressive in structure (as mentioned). Taxing residents based on indirect property valuation. But that catches lower income families and renters, who have little say in, and gain no benefit from the value of the homes they live in.

This is not at all the right conclusion to draw from those numbers.


First of all, it depends on imagining that the richest just create wealth out of nowhere, and that wealth only moves around the economy by taxation and government spending. The majority are also paying for the life of the richest, through the surplus value extracted from their labour.

The Commons Library stat aligns with this. The top 10% of income taxpayers paid over 60% of income tax, confirming a strong redistributive effect.

Unlike many European systems, especially in the Nordics, the UK model is rights-based rather than contribution-based. Nordic countries offer broad, generous benefits, but access/amounts are often linked to prior contributions through social insurance. The UK offers more targeted support regardless of contribution history, which creates a wider pool of recipients and relies more heavily on a smaller group of high earners to fund the system. Combined with a high cost of living, this makes the tax burden more concentrated.

Compared to Nordic and many EU countries, the UK system offers less in return for higher contributors. In much of Europe, benefits are often earnings-linked, meaning those who pay more in receive more out, especially during unemployment or retirement. In the UK, support is largely flat and means-tested, so prior contributions have little bearing on the level of help received. This results in higher earners shouldering a greater share of the tax burden while receiving less support than they would in comparable European systems. The policy focus has been on raising the lowest-income households, effectively flattening the working and underclass, with limited emphasis on maintaining living standards for the middle.",False,False

The numbers don't add up.  £1,600 per month per adult in the UK would cost about 900bn, which would *significantly* increase government spending.  Even if you scrapped every single thing you mentioned to cover it, you'd only have enough spare money to cover about a third of it.  

So it would lead to massive tax rises, which would be a huge disincentive to work.  And of course, that would mean that people were more likely to not bother earning, and set their life up so that they could just live off the free money instead.  And the more people that did that, the more you'd have to increase taxes on those still working to compensate.

From a moral perspective:

You'd end up reducing the money given to disabled people that need support, and instead giving it to people that wouldn't bother working.  Which is immoral.

From a practical perspective:

An entire generation of people would leave school and suddenly be in receipt of more money than they had ever had.

What I don't understand is why the most common mental health conditions (depression, anxiety) meets these criteria. I guess you could say if your so depressed you can't do basic things you need the financial support? 

  
I know someone who gets PIP for anxiety who goes to theme parks and concerts multiple times a month, all the while getting a discount because her husband is her 'carer'.

I strongly believe a lot of it should be used for therapy in the case of anxiety. I hope to become immune to the anxiety and depression I have and be able to handle it, though I don’t count on it given a lot of it stems from being on the spectrum. That being said therapy does me so much good, I’m far better when I’m in therapy and it’s helped me with my work/social life and PIP enables the therapy that keeps me on the straight and narrow. 

When I haven’t been in therapy I’ve been far more isolated, I think a lot of this need for therapy for people with anxiety stems from societal issues that are not easy and may not be possible to solve, e.g decline in living standards, prejudice etc. 

I think there is something to PIP being more targeted in the case of anxiety but on the flip side for other conditions such as people on the spectrum, we are never going to not be on the spectrum and we’re a lot more productive to society if we’re able to work doing something we’re ok with and not being reassessed for a life long condition constantly. Far better than the alternative where we struggle to hold down a job, often in low paid work or end up unemployed. Having a monetary buffer for situations like unemployment is vital for those on the spectrum.

Either I am missing something or this is just incorrect?

As I understand it, if any loan from a company to its directors or shareholders is not repaid within (I think) 9 months, the tax implications are pretty substantial.

A shareholder, director or person connected to a director cannot just take an infinite loan out of the organisation without it being taxed.

I'm against raising CGT but if they reintroduce indexation I'd approve.

The comparison to Income Tax is a category error because there are a lot of cases in which a ""capital gain"" is not a gain at all.

The economic discussion of ""inflation"" I think makes a fairly common sense thing into a complicated academic debate. 

Some common sense examples - I and probably you own tons of things that you could sell for more than their purchase price in £ (e.g. a second hand solid wood table, furniture, bicycle with a good spec that's been looked after, etc) but there's no _actual_ gain because you couldn't then turn around and buy something better, you'd only be able to get the same thing (and if taxed, something of lesser worth).

Gains in the value of shares, a business, a property which has had value added via extensions/refurbishment etc are fundamentally different because there you have the combination of inflation and actual value added.

We have hacks around this like e.g. no CGT on primary residential property but really what makes more sense is to just remove inflation from the calculation and then actually design inflation metrics that track accurately (CPI underreads hugely).",False,False

We can estimate this based on percentiles:

Top 1 million income taxpayers would be roughly the top 3.2% of earners (since 1 million / 31 million = 0.032 or 3.2%).


Income for the top 3.2%

HMRC data from previous years shows that individuals in the top 5% of earners typically had a gross income of around £75,000 or higher.

For the top 1%, incomes generally start at around £160,000 and higher.

Thus, we can estimate that for the top 1 million income tax payers (top 3.2%), the salary would be approximately £90,000 to £100,000 or higher.

This would vary slightly based on the year, but £90,000 to £100,000 is a reasonable range to place the threshold for the top 1 million income taxpayers.",False,False

Which sound reasonable in theory but do not pan out in reality. 

Less profit is still profit and countries like UK remain highly investible. New countries aren't popping up to compete with the UK. That's where these arguments fall down. ""Companies will leave if you raise taxes"". And go where? ""Investment will go elsewhere if you raise CGT"". And go where? If your immediate answer is Middle East/Asia, yes there is a lot of money to be made there, but it also comes at the risk of political instability, political interference, and authoritarian view on doing business there. The Middle East already attracts a lot of an investment without us doing anything, but it is typically a playground for the super rich considering all the strings attached. India and China are attractive too, but their economic strategy tends to be protectionist; they tend to have higher cost of doing business and have a lot protections from investment benefiting their own country first and disincentivising money leaving the country. 

That is also besides the point of CGT. CGT applies when you dispose of assets. In the context of investment, it's the buildings, plants, machinery, trademarks you own. If someone plans to say start a new small business, buy a property as an office space (they don't usually buy though, rent instead), maybe buy some machinery and stuff if it's production based company, and get their company registered etc. do you think they begin this enterprise with one eye on the tax they have to pay on selling their assets when *they dissolve*? This is moronic thinking 

CGT is mainly going to impact margins on day trading, flipping homes, resale market on high value goods, and sales of assets as result of inheritance. On the last point, how likely is someone to hold on to say an extremely valuable asset they got via inheritance, because CGT is too high for them? Will they hold on to it forever?

However I don't think it'll be very effective, and the tax system as a whole is a mess.

Firstly, the amount it will raise is very small in terms of government spending, and a lot of it will just disappear as people change their behaviour. In particular, the government's own figures show that a large majority of the money the 48% tax band would have raised across the current tax base will disappear as people change their behaviour. Now if that's putting extra money in a private pension, I suppose that has some benefit to the government. But if it's reducing hours it's pretty bad, and if it's moving to England, then that's terrible for them. It seems to me that when you get towards 50% marginal tax rate in general, the returns are so low, or even negative, that very few places seem to go higher.

Also while I'm happy to contribute, it would be nice to see the wealthy contribute more. I appreciate that this isn't a particularly easy thing to achieve, but if high earners are going to contribute more, then, for example, now isn't the time for a cut to inheritance tax. (Obviously I appreciate that it's a different government considering that, but I'm talking about the tax system and its fairness overall).

Finally, the bands combined with the withdrawal of allowances etc. make the marginal rates of tax so bumpy that it's confusing, and people are put in situations where the selfish, logical course of action is to work less and be less productive, which is not something we need right now. Although these rules have largely been made with good intentions, a simpler tax system (while remaining progressive) would benefit both the people paying them, the companies they work for, and government revenue.",False,False

>
>    If HMRC sends you a P800 – which it usually does from around June following the end of the tax year in April – it will tell you to request a refund via a bank transfer known as BACS. This can be done by logging into your Government Gateway account. If you don’t have one of these, you can set one up using the Government website.
>
>    If you do not have respond within 21 days, a cheque will be issued to your address. This needs to be cashed within six months.
>
>    If you do not cash it within six months, HMRC says it can be replaced on request. You can contact it online, or by phone, on 0300 200 3300.
>
>    There’s technically no time limit on doing this, but after nine years, it becomes harder for HMRC to verify if you’re owed a refund, so it’s best to request a new cheque before this date.

Look, I hate paying tax as much as the next person (and this hate HMRC by proxy) but it's not a difficult process, and the valid period is huge. This is a reflection of the laziness of the population.

That's actually fucking mental.

And before anyone tries to say bullshit:

There's roughly 32,200,000 total income tax payers in the UK - 27,000,000 of which are on the basic rate threshold which is currently at 20p.

A quick look at the data tells you this - good luck finding journalists who are capable of doing that, let alone are able to challenge any MP who promotes these kinds of economically loony policies with actual facts and data like above...

EDIT: I'll just update this with further points from the thread i've sparked:

Population breakdown: Current population is 67,000,000. Only 32,000,000 pay any form of income tax. This is because:

12,500,000 are pensioners (pretty much all of which get some form of state pension)

12,700,000 are under 16

1,400,000 are unemployed

9,000,000 are economically inactive, of which:
1) 27% are students. 
2) 26% have a long-term illness. 
3) 22% are caring for family. 
4) 13% have taken early retirement.
5) 12% said there was some other reason.

Another fun fact: 2,365,500 people are in work and still don't earn enough that they claim universal credit top up (41.5% of all universal credit claimants).",False,False

Firstly, the rate he wants to apply is lower than the ASI's assessment 20 years ago (22%). And even then they were pretty blatant about it costing £50bn to implement, and that was when the economy was more economically robust to absorb such a shock.

Secondly, the devil is in the details. No mention of student loans, explicit mention of keeping NI as it is. This, in effect, is designed to make it so young graduates and people on lower incomes have a higher tax burden than people on higher incomes, which is bullshit and completely defeats the point of introducing a flat tax. Either fold NI into the flat tax (in effect increasing Corporation Tax and CGT to 32% as well as averaging out the flat tax at 32% across all incomes) or shut up. Not to mention the lack of the personal allowance, even the ASI when they came up with their flat income tax proposed the £12k tax free allowance in conjunction with a flat income tax. What Rees Mogg is appearing to propose is to load the tax burden on young people and lower earners. Good luck trying to explain why someone on a £30k income deserves to have a **higher** (emphasis on higher) average tax rate than someone on £150k because of how NI is applied, that doesn't seem very ""flat"".

Thirdly, no mention of unearned income being punitively disincentivised through tax, a.k.a. huge tax rates on economic rent and landlords. Even the Victorian liberals that espoused the flat tax wanted economic rent to be punitively taxed. John Stuart Mill would have torn this apart, and he vehemently opposed graduated income taxes.

Fourthly, the savings that he's suggesting through relief reform seem massively optimistic (or dishonest), also feeding into point number 1. My guess is that the OBR would have torn it apart (of course Truss didn't want the OBR to assess the budget anyway, because she knew they would tear it apart as fiscally irresponsible). Also, abolishing tax relief on pensions is yet another example of sticking two fingers up to the young who are trying to build a pension pot as older people with private pensions would have already taken advantage of tax free contributions - as well reckless as it disincentivises private pension contributions.

You earn £15k. For every additional £ you earn you lose 12p to NI. You lose 20p to Income Tax. You lose 55p from the Universal Credit taper, post tax. You face a marginal tax rate of 70%. You are much less likely to take up additional hours.


But this only arises due to UC, so surely at a reasonable income-- say the median, around £25k, it'll be better?

Imagine you are a new graduate on the new Plan 5 loan (graduating in 2026.) For your first job you've done rather well and earn £25,000. (if not plan 5, 28k instead, unless plan 1 where this still applies)

For every additional £ you earn you lose 12p to NI. You lose 20p to Income Tax. You lose 9p to student loans. You face a marginal tax rate of 41%. Much better, best it gets 


If you are doing much better, maybe settled in life, and earn £50K (rounded, higher rate) having gone to university with 2 kids you face a marginal tax rate of 9% from loan, 40% from income, 2% from NI or 51%. Then factor in the tapering of child benefit, losing 1% of it with each additional £ or 19p, giving a 70% marginal tax rate


And of course everyone knows about the mess with £100k 60% marginal tax rate because of, guess what, personal allowance taper. So for a graduate (any plan afaik, 9%) you face a combined (NI+Tax+Loan+Loss of PA) marginal tax rate of (40 + 20 + 2 + 9) = 72% marginal tax rate

For every additional kid you have this marginal tax rate increases by +2000% lol. As in, 3 kids would be 6072% marginal tax rate, and you'd be better off declining an £18k pay rise at £99,999 (or rather, salary sacrifice)

If labour aren't going to nationalise natural monopolies, which are essentially economic tollbooths. For fear of scaring capital. Slowly tax the profits to oblivion. Then when the share price eventually tanks, nationalising them cheaply could be realistic.

Perhaps through a democratically accountable state green bank? That way, the assets can be leveraged for further investment and economic multipliers.

It isn't as if the private companies are investing in these key areas at the level necessary to justify the profit/robbery. 

We are having to legislate and effectively bribe these companies with green levy's and taxpayer money to invest in the first place. It is time to end the guaranteed profit gravy train. It is a farce. It only benefits a tiny tiny fraction of the population.

Not only would this direct investment away from essentially unproductive sections of the economy that damage our international competitiveness and raise the cost of living.

 It would allow a redirecting of a chunk of GDP away from offshore vaults and allow the government to reinvest it in areas that deliver long term objectives that the 'market' neglects at our continuing detriment.

There's a delicious irony in say, a green state bank buying up all the water companies, gas companies and rail franchises. Then leveraging these assets for long term returns on sensible infrastructure projects, to deliver net zero and lower COL. With careful and sensible governance, this bank could also invest in a percentage of 'moonshots' that private capital would never touch.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the Prime Minister and Chancellor's six-year freeze on income tax thresholds is the Treasury's single biggest revenue raiser since Geoffrey Howe increased VAT from 8pc to 15pc in 1979.

It will push the number of people paying a tax rate of 40pc or more on their earnings to 7.8 million by 2027-28, according to official estimates. That represents a quadrupling in the share of adults paying the higher rate since the early 1990s.

The change is because of so-called “fiscal drag”, which pushes more people into higher income tax brackets as pay levels rise but tax brackets do not.

Tax allowances traditionally go up in line with inflation but were initially frozen by Mr Sunak from 2022 to 2026. Mr Hunt extended the freeze for two more years when he became Chancellor.


The IFS warned that the freeze will “disincentive work” and drag hundreds of thousands of teachers, nurses and electricians into the higher rate tax band for the first time, adding to the cost of living challenge facing many workers.

Households face a record fall in incomes this year and the IFS said a third of the slump was because of the stealth raid.

The IFS said “essentially no nurses” and only about 5pc of teachers and electricians paid more than the basic rate of income tax in the 1990s. However, one in eight nurses and a quarter of all teachers will be subject to higher rate income tax by 2027.

The situation has been exacerbated by decades of thresholds rising slower than earnings, the IFS said, as well as former chancellor George Osborne's decision to cut higher rate thresholds in cash terms before partially reversing them in the mid-2010s.

“More adults than ever are paying higher-rate tax,“ the think-tank said, adding that the levies once “reserved only for the very highest paid” were now pushing traditionally working and middle class jobs into higher tax traps under Mr Sunak.

The threshold for the highest-rate tax is currently frozen at £50,270. The think-tank calculated that for the 40p rate to hit the same fraction of people as it did in 1991, the higher-rate threshold will need to be “nearly £100,000” by 2027.

Research by the IFS also showed 1.7 million workers were on course to start paying a marginal rate of either 60pc or 45pc by 2027. This is just below the share of adults who paid the 40pc higher rate at the start of the 1990s.


Isaac Delestre, research economist at the IFS, highlighted the “unwelcome proliferation” of “spikes” in Britain's tax system that means people who earn between £100,000 and £125,140 face a marginal tax rate of 60pc on every £1 of extra income earned.

This is because the tax free personal allowance begins to be tapered away at this level, which has been frozen since its introduction in 2010.

Mr Delestre said the so-called “60pc tax trap” was having a “much bigger effect on people's incentives to work” as workers stash more into their pensions or work fewer hours to avoid paying the higher rate.

The IFS said stealth raids were “not a sensible way to make tax policy”. Mr Delestre added: “For income tax, the story of the last 30 years has been one of higher-rate tax going from being something reserved for only the very richest, to something that a much larger proportion of adults can expect to encounter.”

The six-year stealth raid is set to be larger as a share of national income than Mr Hunt's decision to raise corporation tax from 19pc to 25pc. It is also a bigger tax grab than Gordon Brown's decision to abolish the 10p income tax rate in 2007.

Mr Delestre said: “Alongside the fact that 1.7m people will be paying marginal rates of 60pc and 45pc in the next few years, this represents a fundamental and profound change to the nature and structure of our income tax system.”",False,False

My wife can't afford to work as childcare would cost more than her job. After tax, bills etc the money I earn isn't much I definitely wouldn't class myself as well off. Due to earning over 50k not only do I hit the higher tax bracket, I also am no longer entitled to child allowance for both kids as well as not entitled to marriage tax transfer. In fact I think someone earning 49k may be earning more than me with those benefits. Also a couple both earning 20k each is earning more than me or close to it, it's like the government no longer likes traditional family units with 1 person working and making it more difficult.


Someone here suggested that's good higher earners are getting tax more, and suggested tax should be higher and minimum wage should go up. If that does happen I feel like I'm just going to quit my job because it's way more stressful than a lower paid job. I have a friend who does taxis and he is so relaxed. Probably be better to go for lower paid relaxing job and have additional access to benefits. 


I'm also thinking actual working doesn't pay much anymore so looking to invest money somewhere else rather than working too much


Just to also add paying all that tax my road is still got potholes, every other house is a HMO, rubbish all over the roads, can't get an appointment with my GP. No NHS Dentist the list goes on. Forgot to mention my council tax keeps rising too. No wonder a few of my friends have gone to Dubai to earn more money.

The [income tax thresholds](https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates) already include a £12k tax free amount, so it’d only add £1500 a year or a little over £100 a month to the take home pay of a starting nurse and £3500 a year or under £300 per month to the pay packet of a nurse with 5 years service.

Nurses or NHS employees? or government employees? Be specific. Because if you only lower income tax for nurses, you've got a 500k other NHS employees on the same banding system, who are going to be extremely pissed.

And all the impact that entails for them and their kids in their formative years. 

Here's an idea just cut income taxes for all working people  and make up the difference from wealth taxes and nondoms. I'm pretty sure that would encourage more workers. 

Also feel free to ensure workplaces accommodate flexible working an the needs of those with less than great health. If they have that then maybe they might work. If your health benefits go when you begin work an then you could be caused to lose your job due to them quite quickly you just won't want to risk it. 

Oh and another sort out childcare costs so working is more valuable than being a stay at home parent, that might help.

> The basic scheme is that the Government will stump up for 20% of your childcare costs, up to £2,000 per child. You qualify if you and your partner’s earnings hit £7,904, and it’s completely withdrawn if one of your salaries hits £100,000. The result? An infinitely negative marginal tax rate at £7,904 and another brilliantly infinite5positive marginal tax rate at £100,000.

It’s actually even worse than this - as you also lose 15 of your 30 free hours at age three.

So you basically earn £0 for the £100-125k bit of income if you have nursery age kids.

I think a straightforward raising of income tax would've been a better option, the problem being that more obviously breaks the manifesto promise.


The first problem is that it's distortive. It increases the difference on tax rates between earned income, and non-earned income (dividends, rent, pension etc.). I find this both odd from an economic point of view (we are disincentivising work specifically) and a fairness point of view, especially given the emphasis on not taxing ""working people"".


The second problem is how regressive the change is. By shifting the threshold down from £9000 to £5000 you are effectively adding a ~£500 levy *per job* regardless of income (before you even raise the overall rate) - this is clearly going to be difficult for sectors employing low wage workers and will concentrate the effects of tax change more on lower earners. Again this is a step in the wrong direction tax-wise in my view.


My solution as given above if you want more tax is a straightforward raise of income tax. By this I mean the basic and higher rates. Your question mentioned raising the money from increased capital gains or £500k+ income taxes - the NI changes are expected to raise £25bn, and any changes to CGT or income tax at that level would struggle to reach that figure. A 1% income in additional rate tax is estimated to raise £210m a year; so it actually wouldn't be possible to raise £25bn from people warning over £500k only.",False,False

It doesn't depend on profits and just adds a significant additional cost to ongoing operations. A cost which scales massively the larger workforce you have often disproportionately hitting low wage work.


This causes businesses which were profitable to suddenly find themsevles unprofitable and looking for job cuts and cutting hiring plans.


Conversely, employees NI might see the employee worse off but it doesn't actually harm their employment prospects or the profitability of employers business. So their job is safe.


Similarly Corporation tax only looks at profit. So a business struggling on minor profits doesn't see its expenditure suddenly skyrocket, it just loses a small fraction extra of its already tiny profits. A struggling business in this way can't be forced into insolvency as only profit is taxed.


NI in general needs abolishing and rolling into income tax. The ring fence on NI which used to make it special were removed by Brown and its all just general taxationspending now. It's left there because it means labour can increase employers NI and say ""we TECHNICALLY haven't taxed workers"". Or so the tories can up employees NI and say ""we haven't TECHNICALLY changed the headline tax rate"".

The company I work for, I had three roles on the books I was looking to recruit this year, I managed to recruit two prior to that.

The day after the election result, we got put on hiring freeze. On the lead up to the budget, we were told that anyone on probation had to be let go unless we could make a good business case for their staying. I ended up losing my two juniors as a result of this.

It isn't just my company contracting. I was looking at jumping ship this year, mere weeks after the election, most of my friends in other companies had hiring freezes announced and similar measures in place. My Sister works for a fairly large blue chip in London who too have announced hiring freezes amid reassessment of job descriptions, namely salary ranges. That is any jobs that they will re-present to the market will be severely cut in terms of salary.

Looking at job boards, I am amazed at the salaries on offer for other roles. What would have garnered £60k a year prior to covid is struggling to breach £45k. If I am able to bring one of my positions back online to advertise for, my range is down to low £30s instead of the mid £40s it was offering.

This is the result of the budget. The money doesn't magically appear just because companies exist. Organisations have to be encouraged to grow. Slamming them like that in the budget is not a growth budget. And this simple minded retort of ""Oh let those businesses fail, they were going to anyway"" is just stupid.

>	Re: National Insurance contributions

>	We are writing to call on you to exempt GP surgeries, social care providers, hospices, NHS dentists, charitable providers of health and care, and pharmacies from the increase in employers National Insurance contributions. This tax rise will severely impact health and care services for patients and we fear it will make the crisis in our NHS and social care sector even worse.

>	We do not dispute that the country has been left in an awful state by the previous Conservative goverment and that you face an enormous challenge. Hospitals are crumbling, people are struggling to see their GP or NHS dentist, and millions are waiting in pain for NHS treatment.

>	We welcome the extra funding allocated to the NHS at the budget. It was the right decision and a necessary step if the NHS is to recover from the damage done by the Conservatives.

>	But subjecting health services such as GPs and care homes to higher taxes is completely counterproductive. You are giving to the NHS with one hand but taking away with the other.

>	Unlike small employers that are shielded from the full force of this tax increase by the Employment Allowance, GP surgeries and many health and care service providers are not eligible. This rise means many will have no choice but to cut services and staff numbers.

>	That would be a disaster, not just for patients but for the NHS too. We desperately need more GPs and capacity in the care sector. These services are the backbone of our health services and care for millions of people every month. Without them NHS hospitals would be overwhelmed.

>	We urge you to think again. If you won't cancel the rise for all employers, then you must at least exempt those providing vital health and care services, including GP surgeries, social care providers, hospices, NHS dentists, charitable providers of health and care, and pharmacies. Without it the health and care crisis will only worsen.

>	We look forward to hearing from you on this important matter.

>	Yours sincerely,

>	Helen Morgan",False,False

Kemi Badenoch has refused to promise to reverse Rachel Reeves’s National Insurance raid on employers if she became prime minister.

The new Conservative leader said she was more focused on defining her party’s principles rather than “throwing out policies” in the early days of her leadership.

Mrs Badenoch did criticise the wider contents of the Budget as she took aim at the Chancellor’s tax-and-spend approach, predicting that it will make Britain poorer.

National Insurance contributions for employers were increased by 1.2 per cent in Ms Reeves’s Budget last week, which the Treasury said would raise £25 billion.

Asked whether she would undo the policy even if it meant less cash for the NHS, Mrs Badenoch told the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: “I don’t accept the premise of that question.

“We didn’t do those things in order to increase the funding for the NHS so it’s not a binary suggestion… What I will say actually is look at what the OBR stated about the Budget, that there’s no £22bn black hole.

“So that’s dishonest, most of the employer increases are going to be passed over in lower wages and higher prices, that’s not good for people.”

When pressed on whether she would oppose or reverse the measure, Mrs Badenoch replied: “The fact is what you’ve just said. I’m the leader of the opposition, I’m not the chancellor of the exchequer. We have very few MPs. We’re not going to be able to oppose anything in terms of getting legislation through.

“What we can do is make the argument about why we think what they’re doing is wrong. And I am making that argument that raising taxes in this way, whether it’s employer NI or elsewhere, is not going to grow our economy and will make all of us poorer.”

Crucially, the UK is already unattractive enough to warrant companies pulling out. This increase on Employer's NI is an indirect raid on the workers.

We are already seeing companies undergoing hiring freezes. With this rate increase, less people will receive things like annual bonuses or pay raises, we are already seeing a lot of industries with average salaries rocketing downwards given the acute trend of mass outsourcing on a much larger scale than previous years, there is now less incentive to keep people employed in the UK.

To meet those costs, companies will pass those costs onto the things that they sell. If they sell to the public, they will pay more for what they buy. If they sell to other businesses, they will pay more and coupled with their own Employer's NI will be in even less of a position to support their staff financially.

Labour have attempted to disguise this as a tax on the rich. The only thing it does is lower opportunity, innovation and indirectly tax standard working people. Even sitting and thinking about it for a few minutes will answer your question. 

As for the rest of Europe, it's not really comparable. A lot of what countries like Germany and France make is produce that can only come from those countries, or does only come from those countries. Germany has a huge export in vehicles, machinery and electricals, France exports a lot of foodstuffs, dental equipment and aircraft as well as cars. While UK does export some of all of that, the biggest export is services which can be replicated in any country, the main one now being India. While that export of services has been going on for decades, given Keir's free trade agreement, the brakes are now off. Things that previously could not be exported, e.g. financial services, are now happily covered under that FTA. You can expect a lot more companies outsourcing there now as a result.

Couple that with the fact that given this rise in Employer's NI, there is even more incentive to up sticks out of the UK. A lot of medium sized businesses are beginning to incorporate in Europe now in a bid to move primary sales lines there with more administrative functions being left in the UK. Pretty soon, there won't be a need for even that.

Even if we accept the premise that Employer's NI has no impact on the employee (which is wrong, 100%, but let's accept it regardless for the sake of argument). This is still a tax on an employees salary, just paid for by someone else; it's not a tax on wealth, not a tax on wealth-derived income, not a tax on something unrelated work. It is literally a tax on work.

I shouldn't complain too much, even if the cost were passed through to me as an employee (e.g. pay freeze until he employer's costs were neutralised), it would still cost me less than the rumours earlier on in the cycle (e.g. pension tax relief being reduced).

And that's exactly what I'm talking about. Earlier on in the cycle 90% of people were defending reducing tax relief on the basis that it was fundamentally unfair - you have to have enough spare cash to do it in the first place, it benefits those paying tax at a higher rate more than lower rates - etc. (I don't agree, but those were the arguments being made.)

But if this story is accurate, then this change makes salary sacrifice schemes *more* popular, not less. The exact opposite of that earlier rumour that people were keen to defend.

Take each of those sentences in turn: 

* ""Tax burden to a 70-year high""

This is only true of economy wide taxation, including that levied on individuals and corporations. Taxation directly imposed on individuals is actually not especially high, and on middle and lower incomes it is unusually low. So it's clear from this first sentence we are talking about economy wide taxation

* ""Labour will not increase taxes *on* working people""

The manifesto doesn't say ""paid by working people"" it deliberately says ""on"". Hard to interpret this as meaning anything other that referring to all taxes levied *on* labour, whether paid by the employer or employee

* ""we will not increase National Insurance"" 

There are no caveats here - no mention of ""employee only National Insurance"". Particularly given the context of the two leading statements which are both worded to be inclusive of employer *and* employee taxation, hard to interpret this as anything other than meaning no increase to either half of National Insurance

At the moment, the national insurance savings on employer contributions is a pretty good sweetener for higher employer contributions (then just AE mins). Some good hearted employers even pass this saving straight on on the employer.

Take that perk away and what's likely? Well lower employer contributions are far more attractive, and the simple fact is that employers will suddenly have a much bigger tax bill.

Let's say you employ...I dunno, 1000 employees on an average salary and you generously pay a 10% employer contribution. Having to suddenly then pay an extra whack of tax on that is going to hit companies...and hit what they will offer in terms of pension and salary.

I asked my policy manager what would happen and he shrugged and said 'we would probably just lower employer contributions for everyone, write out to (you) all and say we've done that to maintain any annual pay package rise'..

A great idea for the short term government, easy cash and 'the electorate doesn't understand national insurance'.

> 
> The chancellor will make national insurance the central measure in his spring budget after deciding against cutting income tax.
> 
> He will say that the tax cut is worth a total of £900 for the average worker when combined with the two percentage point cut that was announced in the autumn statement.
> 
> Hunt and Rishi Sunak decided against cutting income tax after the Office for Budget Responsibility, an independent watchdog, significantly downgraded the amount of “fiscal headroom” available for tax cuts or spending commitments.
> 
> In December there was about £30 billion but by last week that figure had fallen to £12.8 billion because of a combination of higher government borrowing costs and lower than expected tax receipts.
> 
> Cutting income tax is significantly more expensive as it benefits both workers and pensioners. A cut of two percentage points in employee national insurance costs about £10 billion a year, while a 2p cut in income tax costs £13.7 billion a year. There are also concerns that cutting income tax would be inflationary.
> 
> The government will bring forward legislation next week to enable the national insurance cut to come into effect in April. Hunt will also freeze fuel duty for another year at a cost of about £5 billion.
> 
> The tax cuts are likely to be paid for with tax rises and public spending cuts. Hunt will announce a new levy on vaping with an associated rise in tobacco duty, which will raise about £500 million a year. He is also expected to reduce the scope of non-dom tax relief and extend the levy on the profits of North Sea oil and gas companies. Tax breaks for people with second homes that they let as holiday rentals will also be reduced.
> 
> The chancellor is also considering cutting projected increases for future public spending from two per cent to 0.75 per cent, despite warnings that this could lead to significant cuts for unprotected departments. The move would raise £5 billion a year but leave the Tories open to accusations that its is returning to austerity.
> 
> Hunt will also argue that central government and local authorities need to do more with less, with restricted government spending planned after the election.
> 
> He will tell councils they have until July to submit new productivity plans, including proposals to use technology to improve services and reduce “unnecessary” spending on consultants as well as equality and diversity initiatives.
> 
> Hunt said at the weekend that he wanted Britain to “move towards a lower tax economy”, arguing that he had a “moral duty to leave as much money in people’s pockets as possible”.
> 
> “I do want, where it is possible to do so responsibly, to move towards a lower tax economy, and I hope to show a path in that direction,” he told the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg on the BBC. “This will be a prudent and responsible budget for long-term growth, tackling inflation, more investment, more jobs and that path to lower taxation as and when we can afford that.”

Jeremy Hunt is expected to use next week’s budget to cut national insurance rather than income tax as he announces a new levy on vaping.

The chancellor has significantly scaled back his planned cuts after official forecasts suggested he will have much less money to spend than expected.

The two main tax cuts expected in the budget are a 1 percentage-point reduction in employee national insurance, at a cost of about £4.5 billion a year, and an extension of the fuel duty freeze at a cost of £1 billion a year.

Hunt had been weighing up a 2p cut in income tax but the £13.7 billion a year cost makes it unaffordable in the current climate. The government has also shelved plans to cut stamp duty and inheritance tax and to extend child benefit to middle-income families. The measures will be considered for an autumn statement later in the year or the Conservative Party’s election manifesto.

The budget on March 6 is expected to be far more limited than last year’s autumn statement, in which Hunt cut employee’s national insurance by 2 percentage points. Economists have warned that taxes are still on course to increase by a record amount because of the impact of stealth taxes introduced by the government.

The state of the public finances has forced Hunt to look for new sources of revenue. He will use his budget to announce a “vaping products levy” to be paid on imports and by manufacturers in an attempt to make the habit unaffordable for children.

The duty will be levied on the liquid in vapes, with higher levels of tax for products with more nicotine. There will be a one-off increase in tobacco duty to ensure that vaping remains a cheaper alternative, with the two measures expected to raise more than £500 million a year between them by 2028/29.

The tax is modelled on 15 similar schemes across Europe, with Germany imposing a €1.60 tax on every 10ml of vape liquid and Italy levying €1.30. So-called vape tanks are typically sold in 2ml quantities. The EU is planning a bloc-wide vaping levy.

Sunak is attempting to tread a line between stopping children taking up vaping while at the same time encouraging adult smokers to switch to e-cigarettes, which are considered far less harmful than tobacco. Ministers have acknowledged “the need to balance a price increase that acts as a deterrent with ensuring that vaping remains a more affordable option than smoking, to encourage adult smokers to switch”, according to a consultation report from earlier this month.

About six million people in Britain vape after an explosion in the popularity of the product in recent years. Young people have rapidly become the most prolific users of the products, with usage rising to 22 per cent of those aged 16 to 24.

In an effort to find extra money Hunt is considering increasing public spending by only 0.75 per cent, rather than the 1 per cent as currently planned, a move which could save about £5 billion a year. Economists have warned that this would lead to deep cuts for unprotected departments. However, a senior government source said this approach would be avoided if possible to reduce the risk of the government being accused of a return to austerity.

Whitehall’s room for manoeuvre has been constrained by worsening official forecasts caused by a combination of inflation falling faster than expected, resulting in lower tax revenues, and increased borrowing costs. Last week the Office for Budget Responsibility informed the government that it will have around £13 billion of fiscal headroom, of which Hunt will leave around £6 billion in reserve.

The final forecasts before the budget are expected this Friday.",False,False

Jeremy Hunt will use his autumn statement to cut national insurance for 28 million people and unveil permanent tax cuts for businesses.

The chancellor is expected to reduce the headline rates of national insurance for employees and the self-employed. A 1 per cent cut would cost about £5 billion and be worth roughly £380 a year to someone earning more than £50,000.

Hunt will also make permanent a £10 billion-a-year tax break for companies that invest in equipment and technology, a move he will bill as the biggest tax cut for businesses in modern British history.

He will confirm significant increases in benefits and the state pension after rejecting proposals to save billions by raising them by a smaller amount.

As part of the package Hunt will announce that the lowest-paid workers will have their wages raised by almost 10 per cent next year after he approved a significant increase in the national living wage. From April firms will be required to pay all workers £11.44 an hour, up from £10.42.

Ministers said this represented a rise of more than £1,800 a year for a full-time worker, the third-largest increase in real terms since the living wage was introduced in 2016.

Ministers have become markedly more upbeat about the public finances in recent days and Hunt’s deputy has said that improvements in the economy were “really significant for people at home”, meaning “we can now talk about tax cuts”.

However, even as Hunt insisted the economy was “back on track”, the governor of the Bank of England said that the risk from inflation was being underestimated.
Andrew Bailey told MPs that market expectations of cuts in interest rates in the middle of next year put “too much weight” on recent falls in the speed of price rises, saying that rate-setters remained “concerned about the potential persistence of inflation”.

Hunt has decided to put cuts to national insurance at the heart of his budget because they affect people who are in work. Plans to reduce income tax were considered but are more likely to be unveiled in the spring budget.

At present employees earning more than £12,570 a year pay 12 per cent national insurance on their earnings up to £50,200, while self-employed workers pay 9 per cent. A 1 per cent cut would cost about £5 billion, less than cutting inheritance tax.

However, the Resolution Foundation think tank said that most people would still pay more national insurance overall because of the impact of the decision to freeze the threshold at which people pay it. Critics have described the policy as a “stealth tax” because freezing thresholds rather than raising them in line with inflation means the government takes more of people’s income.
Hunt is expected to announce that benefits will rise by 6.7 per cent, in line with inflation figures from September. Ministers had considered using the October inflation figure of 4.6 per cent, which would have saved £3 billion but hit nine million households struggling to cope with the cost of living.

They are also expected to raise the state pension by 8.5 per cent in line with the normal measure of earnings. They had been considering using a lower measure of inflation that stripped out the effect of bonuses.",False,False

I'll still never vote for them but labour should back and keep these.

The problem the markets had with the Kwarteng cuts were that almost no economist thought they would produce the growth to justify their cuts, but these actually might.

Fundamentally we need to move to an economy that encourages productive activity and discourages rent seeking and that can be done with spending and the tax system. I still think labour should increase taxes for investment, but it should be increasing inheritance tax, increasing capital gains to match income tax and increasing sin taxes like fuel duty and VAT on certain items, and not reversing these tax cuts.",False,False

Still very annoying that full expensing made permanent is being framed as a £10 billion pa cut, this is only for the temporary measure, if made permanent it may only cost £1-£3 billion pa long term and will deliver more growth. This is a welcome highlight for tomorrow and Labour will back it now, they’ve been in favour of it and only cast doubts if extended temporarily because of their fiscal rules. We should be honest in costs in media, reporting this way distracts from solving the marginal tax rate for equity financed investments, but the downside is we continue to subsidise debt financing, more so even with the scheme. Labour should start thinking about how to resolve this.

NICs rate cut instead of income tax cut is cheaper, since pensions aren’t in NIC tax base, as a 1p cut on both employee and self-employed basic rates would cost £5 billion, whilst 1p basic income tax cut cost £7 billion, but also include pensions. Obviously this is their carrot to complement the tightening rules on benefit claims, which is illogical in expecting those on the lowest incomes to secure work from home. It is cruel, and more people are coming under the national insurance tax base because of fiscal drag, so it is not a true cut. Freezing thresholds can be justified in circumstances, but not when the justification is restraining welfare more.

There’s no true ambition held here from the Tories, neither exploring expansion to full expensing to other investments or addressing the debt finance bias, and we are making welfare more cruel whilst cost of living crisis persists.",False,False

In separate interviews with this newspaper, the Tory leadership contenders both said they would cancel Rishi Sunak's planned rise in corporation tax and instead reduce the 25 per cent rate to 15 per cent.

In a bombshell announcement, Mr Javid also stated that he would scrap the controversial National Insurance rise, which was introduced during his time as health secretary to fund the NHS and social care. 

In an apparent attack on Rishi Sunak, his rival for the leadership, Mr Javid said: ""I'm not sure I would have done it if I had been chancellor, but I was focused on my job and I'm not trying to do other people's jobs for them.""

Writing in this newspaper, Simon Clarke, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, revealed that he is backing Liz Truss to become leader and that ""she would reverse the National Insurance rise, returning to the Conservatives’ manifesto commitments and incentivising job creation"".


Mr Javid used his interview to set out an economic plan that also includes bringing forward the planned 1p income tax cut to next year, and a further temporary cut to fuel duty.

While Mr Javid would cut corporation tax by 1p per year to reach 15p, Mr Hunt has pledged to immediately slash the 19p rate to 15p in an autumn Budget. 

The former foreign secretary also set out a plan for a five-year business rates holiday for the most deprived parts of the country, many of which are in the so-called Red Wall.

He criticised Boris Johnson's levelling up agenda for being ""far too New Labour"", focused on high-spend infrastructure projects rather than ""wealth creation"".


Both men implicitly criticise Mr Sunak's record as chancellor, with Mr Javid also taking aim at his rival's insistence that tax cuts should be put on hold until the economy improves.

Meanwhile, writing in this newspaper, Gerard Lyons, Mr Johnson's former economic adviser, backed Penny Mordaunt as the best candidate to ""focus on growth"" and ""truly champion the UK"". 

Dr Lyons, who is now advising Ms Mordaunt, suggested that she would also cancel the planned corporation tax increase and cut fuel duty.

On Saturday Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, ruled himself out of the leadership contest, despite topping a poll of party members. Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, was said to be under pressure from some senior Brexiteers to stand.

Would-be candidates will only have until Tuesday night to gain sufficient numbers of backers to enter the contest, with nominations opening on Monday evening after the election of a new 1922 Committee.

On Saturday, a slew of Tory MPs declared their allegiance to confirmed candidates, as Mr Sunak took a first mover advantage following the announcement of his campaign on Friday. 

Simon Hart, who quit as Welsh Secretary last week, backed Mr Sunak, while Brandon Lewis, the former Northern Ireland Secretary, publicly lent his support to Nadhim Zahawi, the new Chancellor.

In a broadside at Mr Sunak, Mr Javid said: ""Our tax rate now is already almost a 70-year high – and that's happened under the Conservatives. I think that troubles a lot of people. And so I think a prerequisite for growth is tax cuts.

""There are some that say that you can't have tax cuts until you've got growth. I think that's wrong. I think that is fundamentally flawed analysis. I think you can't have growth until you've got the tax cuts.""


Mr Hunt, however, insisted being able to cut taxes did depend on growth, saying: “I would love to see income tax cut, but it has to be done in a way that is sustainable.

“It can't be an electoral bribe and it depends on growth. What you’d need is an income tax cut that is for life, not for Christmas. That means starting by saying we're going to get the economy growing, then you get yourself in a position.”

Mr Hunt, who was health secretary for six years before moving to the Foreign Office, said he would keep the National Insurance increase in place. He said: ""The NHS needs the money.""

Mr Wallace said his decision not to stand had “not been an easy choice to make”, but that his “focus is on my current job and keeping this great country safe”.

On Saturday the former chancellor had 19 declared backers, while Suella Braverman, the Attorney General, and Ms Truss had nine each.

Kemi Badenoch, the Brexiteer former equalities minister, who has set out her stall in an interview in this newspaper, has received the backing of several socially conservative MPs, including Lee Anderson, Tom Hunt and Ben Bradley.

Sir John Hayes, Richard Drax and Philip Hollobone - all Boris Johnson loyalists - have announced their support for Mrs Braverman.

Mr Sunak has revealed the first policy proposal of his campaign was to crack down on gender-neutral language, as he told supporters: “We must be able to call a mother a mother.”

His team has already attracted the support of 10,000 online supporters after his campaign video promising to “restore trust, rebuild the economy and reunite the country” went viral.

Sources close to Ms Truss suggested she was almost ready to announce her own candidacy, after preparations were delayed by an ill-timed visit to Indonesia to the G20.

The Foreign Secretary has now returned to London and is expected to launch her campaign in the next 24 hours.

Writing in The Telegraph on Sunday, Mr Clarke said that one of her core policies will be to cancel the £12 billion National Insurance increase announced by Mr Sunak to fund the NHS and social care.

“People know what to do with their own money better than any government,” he said.

“Liz understands this, which is why she would move swiftly to simplify and cut taxes in order to put more money back in their pockets and ease the cost of living.

“She would reverse the National Insurance rise, returning to the Conservatives’ manifesto commitments and incentivising job creation.”

Mr Zahawi and Grant Shapps have become the latest MPs to throw their hats in the ring, bringing the total number of declared candidates to seven.

Senior party sources expect the total number of runners could be as high as 16 and are planning a high threshold of nominations to whittle the list down to “serious candidates” quickly.

In an interview with this newspaper, Mrs Badenoch expressed concerns that the Government's flagship Online Harms Bill risks criminalising factual statements about biology and sex. She also described herself as an ""aid sceptic"" and said the ""arbitrary"" net zero target was ill-thought through. 

She is standing for the Tory leadership on a platform of ""lighter, simpler, nimbler government"" and expressed fears that some MPs have become hooked on the idea of the state fixing the majority of problems.

The former Treasury minister also took aim at the Government's hands-off approach to the Bank of England over inflation, stating: ""I don't think we should stop the Bank of England being independent, but we do actually have to mark their homework.

""I think we stopped marking their homework for a very long time. If we had been marking their homework, we would have spotted the issue around inflation earlier and done something and probably would have had a different approach. I think maybe some of the money printing we did in 2021 would not necessarily have happened.""

Meanwhile, Mrs Braverman also pledged tax cuts, saying: ""We must get government spending under control. We must slay the inflation beast. We need to cut VAT on energy - and reduce the planned tax increases that are already putting off future investors.

""Ministers and officials must remember that every pound they spend has to come out of your pocket first. And just because millions have been spent on a project does not mean we should keep pouring good money after bad. 

“We need a relentless focus on transparency and measurable performance - whether in hospitals, police stations, or schools. Projects that cannot be measured in terms that matter to ordinary people should be scrapped.""",False,False

Lets look at the numbers you wont discuss

>Tax takes have been below the estimates provided by independent forecasters the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).

>Tax receipts are now £11.4bn below the OBR forecast 11 months into the financial year while borrowing is £20.4bn higher.

>This time last year, the government borrowed £117.5bn but the figure has soared to £132.2bn, a £15bn increase, ONS data showed.

Liz Kendall’s cuts to welfare benefits will push a quarter of a million people into poverty, including 50,000 children, the Government’s own impact assessment has found.

The analysis – which also found that 3.2 million families would lose out financially – prompted deep anger among Left-wing MPs on Labour’s benches.

However, [Mel Stride](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2024/09/10/who-is-mel-stride/), the shadow chancellor, said the Government should have gone further and carried out a more extensive overhaul of welfare rules.

Although Ms Kendall’s plans will bring down the benefits bill by £4.3 billion, the total will still stand at a record £373.4 billion in 2029-30 – up from fewer than £300 billion last year.

Last week, the Work and Pensions Secretary announced sweeping cuts to benefits for sick and disabled people.

These had to be extended on Wednesday by Rachel Reeves, after the Office for Budget Responsibility said the first set of cuts would not raise enough money.

Ms Kendall declined last week to publish the Government’s assessment of the impact of the cuts on benefit claimants. It was instead released on Wednesday as part of the Chancellor’s Spring Statement.

It stated that by 2029/30 there will be 3.2 million families, including current recipients and some future ones who will financially lose as part of Ms Kendall’s reforms.

They will face an average loss of £1,720 per year once inflation is taken into account.

The document also stated that many of these will be pushed into poverty.

It said: “We estimate there will be an additional 250,000 people (including 50,000 children) in relative poverty after housing costs in 2029/30 as a result of modelled changes to social security, compared to the baseline projections.”

I bet that child was not being simply starved as suggested but being fed junk and sugar rather than proper food - hence why they needed all their teeth removed. Bad - but a parent giving the wrong food to a small child is not the same as not having enough money to feed a child.

So yes there could be, and probably is a problem  - but the data collection methods and reporting leave us little the wiser about the extent of the problem.",False,False

For a single parent with a child, this is £125. About 1.2 to 1.3 working days.


Child benifit is 25.60 a week. Which means you're back down to just over 8hrs.


So as a single parent with one child, to be below the destitution line in 2024 outside London, assuming you only get child benifit, you need to work a single day a week in a minimum wage job.

I hope I am wrong. I am concerned that if this approach persists, I am afraid it is highly likely that the state party will continue to fail to address poverty.” 

And it **should** be, otherwise you simply trap people in a constant cycle of relying on the state for their subsistence, which continues on for generations.

Growing up in poverty, with a single parent that struggled to get a stable long term job, is horrendous and can severely limit what a child can do with the rest of their life. Even if it isn't high paying, a stable job that a parent can rely upon for income is significantly better for a child, and their own personal prospects.

Welfare should be viewed as a tool that allows people to love their own lives by their own merits, and a fundamental part of that is getting a job. The alternative is that the state simply encouraged the existence if an underclass of citizens ever reliant on the state, and can do little to overcome this reliance as the state only reinforces this reliance rather than things for their own independent existence.",False,False

They have tested the patience of working taxpayers to the absolute limit. Every year I pay more and more tax, to get less and less in return.

You can only do that for so long till people lose patience. No way our politicians challenge the entitlement of generation triple lock, so they are going to go after those who can't be arsed working.

The problem is, all the scammers have decided that disability benefits are more attractive than unemployment benefits, so have moved on to such benefits. The result is, any clampdown on the scammers is going to hit those who are really sick and disabled.

While I have no issue with people being adequately supported into accommodation with things like furniture and help with debts, if they are not equipped with the skills to sustain this then it's all for nothing.

I spent the best part of a decade working within homelessness services doing a multitude of different roles. Throughout that time I have people I'd work with who'd be involved with services before I started, and were still involved after I left. Being able to sustain accommodation is a skill that some people unfortunately struggle with, with these people being at the highest risk of repeat homelessness. Without adequate schemes to support this and help these people learn these skills, they're destined to fail.

Now, there are schemes that do offer ""tenancy support"", however these services are often very guilty of doing things for their clients, rather than supporting them to do it or learn the skills to do so. It's understandable to an extent, but it doesn't really help and these clients often become very dependent on these services.

So what's the solution? It's hard to say. Theres a need for that immediate work to get someone into accommodation and in a position to be able to succeed, so I commend this study for looking at it in more detail, however we need better commissioned support services that are able to not only offer intervention, but education regarding the skills required to sustain a tenancy to try and promote independence and success.",False,False

That's not a cash transfer. It's potentially interesting, as a different model of assistance. But it doesn't involve giving cash to the homeless, much less to rough sleepers.

In Sunderland, one in eight babies born this year will be referred to Love, Amelia – a charity that supports new parents who would otherwise struggle for the bare essentials – such as clothes and nappies.

That amounts to around 40 infants per month, born into one of the richest economies in the world and yet immediately experiencing a level of poverty that is heartbreaking to imagine.

“It’s frightening,” Steph Capewell, the charity’s chief executive told **i**. “The people who are referred, they’ve arrived in hospital, or they’re preparing for a child and there’s no place for that child to sleep, they’ll be on the floor, on the sofa – out of necessity rather than choice.

“We see so many families where they’re having to ration nappies, where they only have enough for the nighttime and during the day \[babies\] are just at home without a nappy on – which means they can’t access appointments, they can’t go out and play, get some fresh air in the park.

“Or we’ve seen the stark reality where children have got pressure sores because \[parents\] are reusing soiled nappies or going too long between changes.

“These are the real challenges that families are facing every day.”

Sir Keir Starmer is facing rising calls from some within his party to do more to tackle child poverty but has so far resisted scrapping the [two-child limit on benefits](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/starmer-pressure-two-child-benefit-cap-snp-scrap-it-3170133?ico=in-line_link), a move which would instantly lift up to 300,000 children out of poverty across the UK, according to some estimates.

The former chancellor Gordon Brown added his voice to those [calling for change in an interview](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/gordon-brown-two-child-benefit-cap-traps-families-poverty-3376670?srsltid=AfmBOor9NW8nWJipQpZAQv9SJTpeMWQpOIIYsqNcKFqdC37XOjZ7TI7q?ico=in-line_link) with **i** in November. The move threatens to put him at odds with other influential figures – in particular his mayors in the North of England.

Across the North East, around a third of all children are growing up in poverty, a figure which has been getting progressively worse over recent decades.

Labour’s mayor for the region, Kim McGuinness, was elected in May on a pledge to take action. She held a Child Poverty Summit last week attended by hundreds of experts from across the public, private and voluntary sector, to come up with ideas.

While Starmer and Reeves have not moved on child benefit yet, McGuinness is among those calling for it to be scrapped.

“I want to see it lifted, I want to see it done, if not now, as soon as possible, actually I think \[the Government\] do as well,” she said.",False,True

The former Labour Prime Minister also said the benefits cap, which limits the amount of money a household can receive from the state, was making people “worse off”.

“There’s got to be a complete review of the child poverty policy,” Brown told i, adding that “child poverty has become a far bigger problem than pensioner poverty” in recent years.

As a former Labour leader and chancellor, Brown’s comments will put further pressure on the new government. Labour’s position on the two-child cap has led to anger in some quarters, with backbench MPs who are on the left of the party voting to scrap the policy early on in Sir Keir Starmer’s premiership.

The former Prime Minister was speaking at the opening of a new ‘Multibank’ in Middlesbrough. It is the latest branch in a countrywide network, launched by Brown, to distribute items such as clothing, shoes, toiletries, hygiene products, home furnishings, children’s toys and baby goods to families who are struggling to make ends meet.

Labour has already been criticised by poverty experts and charities for keeping the Conservatives’ two-child benefit cap – which means parents can only claim child tax credit or universal credit for two children – as well as the benefits cap. Both policies were introduced by former chancellor George Osborne.

Brown, who as chancellor under Tony Blair introduced tax credits to support low-income families and widened access to child benefit, said the policies were responsible for the uptick in poverty among families with children.

“Since 2010, you’ve had the two-child rule. You’ve had the benefit cap. You’ve had housing benefit limits imposed.

“The series of deductions \[to people’s benefits\] have become very widespread so that half of people \[receiving\] benefits were having deductions.”

Brown said people were “being made worse off” at “every point” because of benefit deductions as well as the “freezing” of child benefit.

Since 2013, parents have received a reduced amount of child benefit once they earn over £50,000 a year.

Scrapping the two-child benefit limit would lift between 250,000 and 300,000 children who are living in households which are below the poverty line out of financial hardship, according to the independent think tank the Resolution Foundation.

Brown said he hoped Labour’s Child Poverty Unit will look at the benefits and how they interact with child poverty.

“We need a complete review of the system,” he said. “That’s going to happen in the next few months. But in the meantime, you can’t let children suffer. You’ve got to do something about it.”

Until the Government publishes its child poverty strategy in 2025, Brown said he hoped his Multibank initiative would “bridge the gap” between state support and the needs of low-income families, particularly in the run-up to Christmas.

Brown added that Multibanks could help people “make a better life for themselves” by taking a “holistic view” of poverty and providing low-income families with everything they need, not just the basics.

Speaking to **i**, they expressed their outrage at the “[ageist](https://inews.co.uk/news/government-ageist-pensioners-betrayed-labour-spending-cuts-3232471?ico=in-line_link)” proposals, and claimed they were being forced into frugal “post-war” lifestyles.

Jennie Leggatt, 74, from Bromley, south-east London, told **i** that she suffers from a degenerative lung condition that gets worse when she breathes cold air.

“I’ve got a very rare lung condition called hypersensitivity pneumonitis. It’s autoimmune and it does what it says: it mimics pneumonia,” she said.

“It doesn’t respond to antibiotics and it is the thing that will probably kill me, because it \[increasingly\] causes, each time I have a flare-up, a degeneration in my lungs and my lung function.

“All we do for that condition is manage it. However, crucial to managing that illness, which is pretty serious and has put me in the hospital on a number of occasions, is breathing in warm air and not breathing in cold air.”",False,True

Except there will always be a percentage of people unable to get such jobs, or find employment at all, yet the report clearly states its the broken social security system which is the main reason so many face deep poverty.

The 74-year-old former NHS nurse ran into dire trouble in January 2022 when her savings ran out.

She discovered that her [state pension](https://inews.co.uk/topic/pensions?ico=in-line_link) was not enough to survive on. Ms Sithole turned to food banks to get enough to eat, and put her heating on only one hour a day even in the coldest weather.

The former nurse is worried more pensioners will be pushed into poverty in the months ahead because of the [Labour Government](https://inews.co.uk/topic/labour?ico=in-line_link)’s decision to [scrap universal winter fuel payments of up to £300](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/labour-voters-verdict-winter-fuel-cut-3271558?ico=in-line_link).

“I’m disappointed,” she told **i**. “It is frightening. There are people who die of pneumonia because they can’t afford to put the heating on. We can’t allow more people to die like that.”

Ms Sithole added: “I don’t think they realise how much older people really struggle, how much they are forgotten and are cast aside, having contributed to this country.”

Her warning comes as a new report by Independent Age, shared first with **i**, lays bare the stark struggles of pensioners in poverty and fears of further hardship this winter.

Some older people told the charity they can’t afford to put the heating on, even after receiving the winter fuel payment.

Some are skipping meals, or surviving on discounted “yellow sticker” items at the supermarket that are close to their sell-by-date.

New YouGov polling for the report found that half (50 per cent) of all older people in England on a low income are worried about paying their energy bills in the next six months.

The survey also found that half of those on less than £15,000 a year struggled to pay their bills for electricity (51 per cent) and gas (49 per cent) in the six months to July.

And more than half of pensioners on low incomes (52 per cent) struggled to pay for food, either occasionally or constantly, during the period.

Independent Age’s *Two Million Too Many* report – a reference to [the 1.9 million pensioners currently below the poverty line](https://insights.lcp.com/rs/032-PAO-331/images/What%20are%20the%20Chancellor%E2%80%99s%20options%20for%20Winter%20Fuel%20Payments.pdf) – is also based on contributions from 270 older people and professionals working with them.

One pensioner told the charity they could not afford to put their heating on, despite struggling with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bronchiectasis.

“Last winter was bad, I think the next one will be worse,” they said. “It will be nigh on impossible.”

Other older people have taken up part-time jobs in their seventies because their state pension is not enough to get by each month.

“Things are difficult,” said one. “My pension pays for rent and council tax. At 76, I’m having to work part time to pay for food.”

Ms Sithole said she did not imagine she would when she retired in 2019 that she would have burnt through her savings by the start of 2022.

She said she was living on less than £500 a month from her basic state pension, not having had enough qualifying years for the full amount.

“The state pension was just not enough. I was really desperate,” she said. “I was skipping meals and buying discounted things that were about to pass its sell-by-date. I might have a tin of soup for a meal. So I had to get a bit more help.”",False,True

The Government is particularly keen to promote pension credit so that the poorest pensioners will continue to receive the Winter Fuel Payment, which is to be abolished for those not on benefit.

The problem with these publicity campaigns is that – however well-meaning they may be – they miss the point. Means-tested benefits have always had a structural problem, namely that many of those who are entitled simply do not claim.

In the case of pension credit, the Department for Work and Pensions itself thinks that there could be 800,000 pensioners who are missing out, with an average unclaimed amount of around £2,000 per year.

There are many reasons why people may not claim their dues, and some of these will not be overcome simply by a publicity campaign. People may not realise they are entitled because the calculations are so complex. Or they may (wrongly) think that they are not allowed to claim if they own their own home or have savings in the bank.

More fundamentally, some older people feel claiming “benefits” from the state has a certain stigma attached to it. They may regard the state pension as theirs by right because they have “earned it” through years of paying national insurance, and consider anything else a handout. They would rather get by than ask for help.

Linked to this is the sometimes intrusive process of claiming benefits, something which people on lower incomes may have experienced before they reached pension age. Having to provide full details of your income and savings and that of your partner can feel both invasive and bureaucratic.

But, crucially, there is a significant group of people amongst the 800,000 who don’t take up pension credit who are engaging with the benefit system – just not with DWP. These are the people struggling to pay their rent and/or council tax and who turn to their local authority for support.

It may seem surprising, but a good number of those who miss out on pension credit do jump through all the hoops and supply all the information needed to get housing benefit or council tax help from their local council.

A key question therefore is why the Government doesn’t simply use the information that people have already supplied to the council and automatically assess them for pension credit at the same time? After all, the information that is required to assess the different benefits is virtually identical.

The main reason seems to be that, as things stand, councils cannot share information obtained by them for one purpose with DWP to use for another – even if this could be hugely to the claimant’s benefit.

So, as a result, the DWP is now writing letters to councils imploring them to engage with this group and encourage them to make a claim for pension credit. But unfortunately, the barriers to claiming, including the bureaucracy involved, means many will still not take up their entitlement despite this extra prompt.",False,False

Our taxes are as high as they've been in living memory yet our standard of living feels considerably worse in many respects, and many people are left uneducated as a result without any sense of opportunity. You've then had a government successfully convince everyone that immigrants are the **sole** cause for all of this, while others go too far the other way and are convinced it's not an issue at all.

I think if you put any one of us under a specific set of circumstances we'd react in ways that don't reflect who we really are. Some would fall into a depression, others become violent. That's not to condone the violence but there is a reason people are the way they are, no one is born like this.

In short, yes, a large part of the reason for all of this is poverty and wealth inequality, though I'd argue it predates the previous Tory government. A lot of the housing crisis and immigration issues started under Blair, and even long before that Thatcher pretty much killed off/fucked up a lot of our industry and social housing by way of relentless privatisation.

Keir Starmer has suspended seven Labour MPs because they voted to overturn a Tory policy which imposes poverty on children. Sure, another tale will be spun: that by voting for the Scottish National party’s amendment to abolish the two-child benefit cap, the seven undermined the unity of the parliamentary Labour party and were duly disciplined. But that is nonsense.

It isn't nonsense, Owen.

For a start, this wasn't *actually* a vote on the cap, this was a vote on including mentioning it in the King's Speech.  In the hypothetical (and unlikely) situation where the amendment passed, it wouldn't have actually removed the cap at all.  Merely made it so the government were declaring that they would.

So the seven rebels were *not* voting to overturn the Tory policy.  I don't know if Owen doesn't understand that (which would make him completely unsuited to being a political commentator) or if he's just pretending that he doesn't (which would suggest that he's just looking for an excuse to attack the PM), but either way this is an appalling article.

>It is hard to imagine Starmer is unaware of the fact that Osborne devised the policy to stoke public hostility towards and create a Victorian caricature of the undeserving, overbreeding poor. 

Oh, please.  It is perfectly reasonable to object to the cap, but can we do it without painting the supporters (which let's not forget, include [60%](https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/50140-public-support-retaining-the-two-child-benefit-limit-as-starmer-gears-up-for-first-rebellion) of the public) as being Scrooge-esque people who get their jollies from hurting the poor?

The argument has always been that the social contract between taxpayers and benefit receivers will only last as long as the public sees that being on benefits doesn't make you better off than those that are actually paying for those benefits.  Where people are having to tighten their belts, which may include not having as large a family as they would like because they can't afford it, it is unreasonable to expect them to fund someone else to have that large family.  Now, it's perfectly reasonable to disagree with that (and to be clear, I'm not taking a position in this comment), but can we do without the ""everyone that disagrees with me is evil!"" rhetoric?",False,True

https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/15203/does-cutting-child-benefits-reduce-fertility-in-larger-families-evidence-from-the-uks-two-child-limit

They review older research that showed a more than 15 percent increase in childbirth amongst relevant demographics in response to an income increase offered for additional children of 10 percent

Their findings, looking at incentives in the opposite direction, only found a 5 percent fall in childbirth amongst relevant demographics in response to the 2 child cap, which represented an average 14% fall in financial incentives

So, it doesn't show the 2-child cap has had no effect, just that the response so far has been smaller than expected given the findings of prior research

They go into a number of reasons this could be, including:

* Low awareness. They find that only half of families effected were aware of the cap. So with greater awareness over time there could be double the impact of the policy

* Demographic change and religion. They find much lower responsiveness to financial incentives when considering family size in Muslim & Orthodox Jewish families. Rapidly growing Muslim share of parents giving birth, and larger families to Muslim parents weren't controlled for. Controlling for this factor would have near certainly showed a larger response to the incentives presented by the cap

* Selection bias. The sample of families looked at by the study was restricted to larger families affected either by the two-child limit or the benefit cap. Hard to understate how important this limitation is. This means that women who had been deterred from having a 3rd child by the policy, and who fall below the overall benefit cap limit, will have been excluded from the sample studied. For this reason it is near certain the study understates the true childbirth response to the cap

TLDR - it isn't nearly as cut and dry as the LSE are making out. It's entirely plausible that with passage of time leading to greater awareness of the cap, a wider sample without selection bias, and by controlling for immigration and population change, a better constructed study would show the cap having exactly its intended effect",False,True

One can argue about the definition of poverty (which is a relative concept in the UK and clearly different to the concept of poverty in, say, Somalia). That we have people in work who are using foodbanks tells its own story; as does the fact that many people in work are claiming one or more benefits. 

The argument around child-benefit is telling in itself - at the relevant level of cut-off net income, you are already moving close to the top percentile (10%) of income-earners. The argument around the threshold for inheritance tax (which most people will never pay relative to the value of their estate) is also telling. These are arguments viewed through the lens of the notably better-off.

I try to be balanced, but it is difficult to take lectures from a man who (with his wife) sits in the top 1% (or likely smaller fraction thereof) of attributable per-capita net-wealth in the country. If he spent a year working as (and living on the wage of) an Amazon warehouse worker, or a food delivery driver, or a care-home support worker, then I would listen more readily to his admonitions.

Capitalism and free-market logic have many advantages. But the quid-pro-quo, for a healthy society, is the safety-net to which all those who benefit therefore contribute (because it could be you next year, or the year after that etc). There is no such thing as 'full employment' (you can never perfectly match supply and demand), unless you wish to live in a communist society (and, even then, it is nominal, and there are usually other drawbacks \[check out history\]...).

Yes, some people will take the p\*ss (of course they will). But, contrary to certain newspapers of certain political leanings, it is a minority (and they cost us less than the legal tax avoidance by the ultra-wealthy individuals and corporations). Better five guilty men go free than one innocent man go to prison. Same with benefit fraud - you don't punish the majority because of the actions of a minority. 'Making work pay' is achieved by making work pay, not by punitively hitting those who cannot (for entirely good reason).",False,False

[Every Tory manifesto ](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/tory-health-education-record-audit-election-3118515?ico=in-line_link)since 2010 has pledged to get people into work. Whether for the chronically unemployed, young people lacking in skills, or the disabled and long-term sick – the Conservatives have said they believe in “making work pay”.

This resulted in the Conservative-led governments of the last decade and a half introducing significant changes to the welfare system. The flagship has been the introduction of universal credit from 2013 which aimed to both simplify benefits and provide a greater incentive for people to work.

Initially controversial and criticised by opposition parties it has now gained wider support and is accepted as being more modern and agile than its predecessor benefits. It came into its own during the pandemic when millions were forced to sign up for out of work support almost overnight and the system was able to cope.

[In an interview with **i** ](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/universal-credit-austerity-covid-benefit-reforms-right-iain-duncan-smith-2261261?ico=in-line_link)marking the ten year anniversary of universal credit, its architect and former work and pensions secretary Sir Iain Duncan Smith said the benefit saved lives when Covid hit. But he, and host of other welfare experts, see the introduction of universal credit as just the first step in what should be a much wider change.

Ed Davies, of Sir Ian’s think-tank the Centre for Social Justice, told **i**: “For all the bumps in the road universal credit has since won cross-party support and is seen as an improvement. It is interesting, the feeling is we need to build on and adapt it rather than change it, so I would say that is a hard-fought change that was for the better.”

# Universal credit a ‘great success’

A former Conservative government official is even more effusive, saying “universal credit is one of the great successes of the Conservatives’ time in government”.

“I think it will be an enduring reform to the welfare system, one that was tested hard during Covid-19 and which worked,” they said. “It successfully helps people back into work.”

They argued that the 2022 “Way to Work campaign” had also helped move hundreds of thousands of people into jobs, and that adjustments to the additional earnings threshold had helped people get support from Job Centres for some time after having moved into employment.",False,True
